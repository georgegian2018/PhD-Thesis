                 important for elucidating the context-dependent
                 transcriptional regulation during development. Recently,
                 high-resolution sampling approaches, such as RNA tomography or
                 single-cell RNA-seq combined with fluorescence in situ
                 hybridization (FISH), have provided indirect ways to view
                 global gene expression patterns in three dimensions. Now in
                 situ sequencing technologies, such as fluorescent in situ
                 sequencing (FISSEQ), are attempting to visualize the genetic
                 signature directly in microscope images. This article will
                 examine the basic principle of modern in situ and single-cell
                 genetic methods, hurdles in quantifying intrinsic and
                 extrinsic forces that influence cell decision-making, and
                 technological requirements for making a visual map of gene
                 regulation, form, and function. Successfully addressing these
                 challenges will be essential for investigating the functional

                 heterogeneity in gene expression levels in seemingly

                 are prone to high levels of unexplained technical noise,

                 genuine heterogeneous expression within the population of
                 cells under study. BASiCS (Bayesian Analysis of Single-Cell
                 Sequencing data) is an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model
                 where: (i) cell-specific normalisation constants are estimated
                 as part of the model parameters, (ii) technical variability is
                 quantified based on spike-in genes that are artificially
                 introduced to each analysed cell's lysate and (iii) the total
                 variability of the expression counts is decomposed into
                 technical and biological components. BASiCS also provides an
                 intuitive detection criterion for highly (or lowly) variable
                 genes within the population of cells under study. This is

                 contributions, quantities that can be easily interpreted by

                 measurements from mouse Embryonic Stem Cells. Cross-validation
                 and meaningful enrichment of gene ontology categories within

  abstract    = "Complex tissues, such as the brain, are composed of multiple
                 different cell types, each of which have distinct and
                 important roles, for example in neural function. Moreover, it
                 has recently been appreciated that the cells that make up
                 these sub-cell types themselves harbour significant
                 cell-to-cell heterogeneity, in particular at the level of gene
                 expression. The ability to study this heterogeneity has been
                 revolutionised by advances in experimental technology, such as
                 Wholemount in Situ Hybridizations (WiSH) and single-cell
                 RNA-sequencing. Consequently, it is now possible to study gene
                 expression levels in thousands of cells from the same tissue
                 type. After generating such data one of the key goals is to
                 cluster the cells into groups that correspond to both known
                 and putatively novel cell types. Whilst many clustering
                 algorithms exist, they are typically unable to incorporate
                 information about the spatial dependence between cells within
                 the tissue under study. When such information exists it
                 provides important insights that should be directly included
                 in the clustering scheme. To this end we have developed a
                 clustering method that uses a Hidden Markov Random Field
                 (HMRF) model to exploit both quantitative measures of
                 expression and spatial information. To accurately reflect the
                 underlying biology, we extend current HMRF approaches by
                 allowing the degree of spatial coherency to differ between
                 clusters. We demonstrate the utility of our method using
                 simulated data before applying it to cluster single cell gene
                 expression data generated by applying WiSH to study expression
                 patterns in the brain of the marine annelid Platynereis
                 dumereilii. Our approach allows known cell types to be
                 identified as well as revealing new, previously unexplored
                 cell types within the brain of this important model system.",

                 gene expression over the whole transcriptome, but it lacks
                 spatial context. In contrast, in situ hybridization provides
                 the location of gene expression, but only for a small number
                 of genes. Here we detail a protocol for genome-wide profiling
                 of gene expression in situ in fixed cells and tissues, in
                 which RNA is converted into cross-linked cDNA amplicons and
                 sequenced manually on a confocal microscope. Unlike
                 traditional RNA-seq, our method enriches for context-specific
                 transcripts over housekeeping and/or structural RNA, and it
                 preserves the tissue architecture for RNA localization
                 studies. Our protocol is written for researchers experienced
                 in cell microscopy with minimal computing skills. Library
                 construction and sequencing can be completed within 14 d, with

  abstract    = "Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a tool for visualizing protein
                 expression that is employed as part of the diagnostic workup
                 for the majority of solid tissue malignancies. Existing IHC
                 methods use antibodies tagged with fluorophores or enzyme
                 reporters that generate colored pigments. Because these
                 reporters exhibit spectral and spatial overlap when used
                 simultaneously, multiplexed IHC is not routinely used in
                 clinical settings. We have developed a method that uses
                 secondary ion mass spectrometry to image antibodies tagged
                 with isotopically pure elemental metal reporters. Multiplexed
                 ion beam imaging (MIBI) is capable of analyzing up to 100
                 targets simultaneously over a five-log dynamic range. Here, we
                 used MIBI to analyze formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human
                 breast tumor tissue sections stained with ten labels
                 simultaneously. The resulting data suggest that MIBI can
                 provide new insights into disease pathogenesis that will be

                 high-resolution, spatially resolved functional profiles in a
                 broad range of model plant systems. Our process includes
                 high-throughput spatial transcriptome profiling followed by
                 spatial gene and pathway analyses. We first demonstrate the
                 feasibility of the technique by generating spatial
                 transcriptome profiles from model angiosperms and gymnosperms

                 cellular, circuit, and organ-wide scale requires 3D anatomical
                 and phenotypical maps, currently unavailable for many organs
                 across species. At the root of this knowledge gap is the
                 absence of a method that enables whole-organ imaging. Herein,
                 we present techniques for tissue clearing in which whole
                 organs and bodies are rendered macromolecule-permeable and
                 optically transparent, thereby exposing their cellular
                 structure with intact connectivity. We describe PACT (passive
                 clarity technique), a protocol for passive tissue clearing and
                 immunostaining of intact organs; RIMS (refractive index

                 and PARS (perfusion-assisted agent release in situ), a method
                 for whole-body clearing and immunolabeling. We show that in
                 rodents PACT, RIMS, and PARS are compatible with
                 endogenous-fluorescence, immunohistochemistry, RNA

                 promising approach to spatially resolved single-cell
                 transcriptomics because of its ability to directly image and
                 profile numerous RNA species in their native cellular context.
                 However, background-from off-target binding of FISH probes and
                 cellular autofluorescence-can become limiting in a number of
                 important applications, such as increasing the degree of
                 multiplexing, imaging shorter RNAs, and imaging tissue
                 samples. Here, we developed a sample clearing approach for
                 FISH measurements. We identified off-target binding of FISH
                 probes to cellular components other than RNA, such as
                 proteins, as a major source of background. To remove this
                 source of background, we embedded samples in polyacrylamide,
                 anchored RNAs to this polyacrylamide matrix, and cleared
                 cellular proteins and lipids, which are also sources of
                 autofluorescence. To demonstrate the efficacy of this
                 approach, we measured the copy number of 130 RNA species in
                 cleared samples using multiplexed error-robust FISH (MERFISH).
                 We observed a reduction both in the background because of
                 off-target probe binding and in the cellular autofluorescence
                 without detectable loss in RNA. This process led to an
                 improved detection efficiency and detection limit of MERFISH,
                 and an increased measurement throughput via extension of
                 MERFISH into four color channels. We further demonstrated
                 MERFISH measurements of complex tissue samples from the mouse
                 brain using this matrix-imprinting and -clearing approach. We
                 envision that this method will improve the performance of a
                 wide range of in situ hybridization-based techniques in both

                 in a complex trait, has been of fundamental interest to
                 geneticists for decades. Recently, partitioning the
                 heritability accounted for by common variants into the
                 contributions of genomic regions has received a lot of
                 attention given its important applications for understanding
                 the genetic architecture of complex traits. Current methods
                 partition the total heritability by jointly estimating the
                 contributions of all regions. However, these methods are
                 computationally intractable and can be inaccurate when the
                 number of regions is large. In this paper, we present an
                 alternative approach that partitions the total heritability
                 into the contributions of an arbitrary number of regions. We
                 demonstrate by using simulations that our approach is more

                 approaches. Using a data set from a genome-wide association

                 CD11c(+) CD11b(hi) F4/80(+) monocyte-derived dendritic cells

                 zones (T zones) of secondary lymphoid tissues, but by 24 h
                 post-infection moDCs are readily discernible in these sites.
                 The accumulation of moDCs is more dependent upon bacterial
                 viability than bacterial virulence. Kinetic studies showed
                 that moDCs were necessary to prime but not sustain Th1

              suppression and susceptibility to the malaria parasite,
              Plasmodium, is mediated by type I IFN; however, it is unclear how
              type I IFN suppresses immunity to blood-stage Plasmodium
              parasites. During experimental severe malaria, CD4+ Th cell
              responses are suppressed, and conventional DC (cDC) function is
              curtailed through unknown mechanisms. Here, we tested the
              hypothesis that type I IFN signaling directly impairs cDC
              function during Plasmodium infection in mice. Using cDC-specific
              IFNAR1-deficient mice, and mixed BM chimeras, we found that type
              I IFN signaling directly affects cDC function, limiting the
              ability of cDCs to prime IFN-$\gamma$-producing Th1 cells.
              Although type I IFN signaling modulated all subsets of splenic
              cDCs, CD8- cDCs were especially susceptible, exhibiting reduced
              phagocytic and Th1-promoting properties in response to type I

              response to Plasmodium infection required type I IFN signaling in
              cDCs themselves, revealing their contribution to a feed-forward
              cytokine-signaling loop. Together, these data suggest abrogation

                 signals required for Tfh cell differentiation and the time at
                 which Tfh cell differentiation occurs. Here we determine that
                 Tfh cell development initiates immediately during dendritic

                 cell division of CD4(+) T cells, at day 2 after an acute viral

               limit host-protective immunity following intradermal infection
               with Trypanosoma cruzi. Concomitant with the upregulation of
               immune inhibitory mediators, including IL-10, TGF-$\beta$1, IDO,
               and programmed death ligand 2, T. cruzi infection induced an
               early increase of Gal-1 expression in vivo. Compared to their
               wild-type (WT) counterpart, Gal-1--deficient ( Lgals1−/− ) mice
               exhibited reduced mortality and lower parasite load in muscle
               tissue. Resistance of Lgals1−/− mice to T. cruzi infection was
               associated with a failure in the activation of Gal-1--driven
               tolerogenic circuits, otherwise orchestrated by WT dendritic
               cells, leading to secondary dysfunction in the induction of
               CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. This effect was accompanied
               by an increased number of CD8+ T cells and higher frequency of
               IFN-$\gamma$--producing CD4+ T cells in muscle tissues and

               reinforced T cell--dependent anti-parasite immunity when
               adoptively transferred into WT mice. Thus, endogenous Gal-1 may

                 Although several mechanisms have been elucidated that regulate

                 multi-branching cell lineages from single-cell data are

                 macrophage/DC progenitors through common DC progenitor to

                 CD4(+) T-cells and CD4(+) T-cell help for the B-cell response
                 are required for control and elimination of infected red blood
                 cells. CD4(+) T-cells are also important for controlling
                 Plasmodium pre-erythrocytic stages through the activation of
                 parasite-specific CD8(+) T-cells. However, excessive
                 inflammatory responses triggered by the infection have been
                 shown to drive pathology. Early classical experiments
                 demonstrated a biphasic CD4(+) T-cell response against
                 erythrocytic stages in mice, in which T helper (Th)1 and

                 contribute to acute erythrocytic-stage pathology, it became
                 apparent that a classical Th2 response producing IL-4 is not a

                 limited understanding of mechanisms mediating protection is a
                 major barrier to vaccine development. We have demonstrated
                 that acquired human anti-malarial antibodies promote
                 complement deposition on the merozoite to mediate inhibition
                 of erythrocyte invasion through C1q fixation and activation of
                 the classical complement pathway. Antibody-mediated
                 complement-dependent (Ab-C') inhibition was the predominant
                 invasion-inhibitory activity of human antibodies; most
                 antibodies were non-inhibitory without complement. Inhibitory
                 activity was mediated predominately via C1q fixation, and
                 merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 were identified as major
                 targets. Complement fixation by antibodies was very strongly
                 associated with protection from both clinical malaria and
                 high-density parasitemia in a prospective longitudinal study
                 of children. Ab-C' inhibitory activity could be induced by
                 human immunization with a candidate merozoite surface-protein
                 vaccine. Our findings demonstrate that human anti-malarial
                 antibodies have evolved to function by fixing complement for
                 potent invasion-inhibitory activity and protective immunity.",

                 parasites is imperative if we are to sustainably reduce the
                 morbidity and mortality caused by this infection. Such a
                 vaccine should elicit long-lasting immune responses against
                 conserved determinants in the parasite population. Most
                 blood-stage vaccines, however, induce protective antibodies
                 against surface antigens, which tend to be polymorphic.
                 Cell-mediated responses, on the other hand, offer the
                 theoretical advantage of targeting internal antigens that are
                 more likely to be conserved. Nonetheless, few of the current
                 blood-stage vaccine candidates are able to harness vigorous T
                 cell immunity. Here, we present what we believe to be a novel
                 blood-stage whole-organism vaccine that, by combining low
                 doses of killed parasite with CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide
                 (CpG-ODN) adjuvant, was able to elicit strong and
                 cross-reactive T cell responses in mice. Our data demonstrate
                 that immunization of mice with 1,000 killed parasites in
                 CpG-ODN engendered durable and cross-strain protection by
                 inducing a vigorous response that was dependent on CD4+ T
                 cells, IFN-gamma, and nitric oxide. If applicable to humans,
                 this approach should facilitate the generation of robust,
                 cross-reactive T cell responses against malaria as well as
                 antigen availability for vaccine manufacture.",

  abstract    = "A central question in biology is whether variability between
                 genetically identical cells exposed to the same culture
                 conditions is largely stochastic or deterministic. Using
                 image-based transcriptomics in millions of single human cells,
                 we find that while variability of cytoplasmic transcript
                 abundance is large, it is for most genes minimally stochastic
                 and can be predicted with multivariate models of the
                 phenotypic state and population context of single cells.
                 Computational multiplexing of these predictive signatures
                 across hundreds of genes revealed a complex regulatory system
                 that controls the observed variability of transcript abundance
                 between individual cells. Mathematical modeling and
                 experimental validation show that nuclear retention and
                 transport of transcripts between the nucleus and the cytoplasm
                 is central to buffering stochastic transcriptional
                 fluctuations in mammalian gene expression. Our work indicates
                 that cellular compartmentalization confines transcriptional

                 of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has
                 become commonplace in biology. It is often the case that
                 thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested
                 against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are
                 expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to
                 measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies

                 approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true
                 and false positives that is automatically calibrated and
                 easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical
                 significance called the q value is associated with each tested
                 feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value,
                 except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false
                 discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our
                 approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while

                 provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving
                 multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while
                 still taking full account of biological variation. Biological
                 variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the
                 technical variation associated with sequencing technologies.
                 Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own
                 specific variability, even when there are relatively few
                 biological replicates from which to estimate such variability.
                 The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the
                 Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data
                 demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods
                 (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design,
                 and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The
                 case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific
                 variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across
                 genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and
                 variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with
                 inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on
                 changes that are consistent between biological replicates.
                 Parallel computational approaches are developed to make
                 non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the
                 application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and
                 practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted
                 profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of
                 biological variability in complex situations. When variation
                 is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an
                 advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming
                 common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods
                 developed here can also be applied to count data arising from
                 DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks
                 and DNA methylation analyses.",

  abstract    = "Functional genomics efforts face tradeoffs between number of
                 perturbations examined and complexity of phenotypes measured.
                 We bridge this gap with Perturb-seq, which combines
                 droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq with a strategy for
                 barcoding CRISPR-mediated perturbations, allowing many
                 perturbations to be profiled in pooled format. We applied
                 Perturb-seq to dissect the mammalian unfolded protein response
                 (UPR) using single and combinatorial CRISPR perturbations. Two
                 genome-scale CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens identified
                 genes whose repression perturbs ER homeostasis. Subjecting
                 ∼100 hits to Perturb-seq enabled high-precision functional
                 clustering of genes. Single-cell analyses decoupled the three
                 UPR branches, revealed bifurcated UPR branch activation among
                 cells subject to the same perturbation, and uncovered
                 differential activation of the branches across hits, including
                 an isolated feedback loop between the translocon and
                 IRE1$\alpha$. These studies provide insight into how the three
                 sensors of ER homeostasis monitor distinct types of stress and
                 highlight the ability of Perturb-seq to dissect complex
                 cellular responses.",

  abstract    = "In multicellular organisms, dedicated regulatory circuits
                 control cell type diversity and responses. The crosstalk and
                 redundancies within these circuits and substantial cellular
                 heterogeneity pose a major research challenge. Here, we
                 present CRISP-seq, an integrated method for massively parallel
                 single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and clustered regularly
                 interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-pooled screens.
                 We show that profiling the genomic perturbation and
                 transcriptome in the same cell enables us to simultaneously
                 elucidate the function of multiple factors and their
                 interactions. We applied CRISP-seq to probe regulatory
                 circuits of innate immunity. By sampling tens of thousands of
                 perturbed cells in vitro and in mice, we identified
                 interactions and redundancies between developmental and
                 signaling-dependent factors. These include opposing effects of
                 Cebpb and Irf8 in regulating the monocyte/macrophage versus
                 dendritic cell lineages and differential functions for Rela
                 and Stat1/2 in monocyte versus dendritic cell responses to
                 pathogens. This study establishes CRISP-seq as a broadly

                 hinders complex study designs. We describe a sample
                 preservation method that maintains transcripts in viable
                 single cells, allowing one to disconnect time and place of
                 sampling from subsequent processing steps. We sequence
                 single-cell transcriptomes from >1000 fresh and cryopreserved
                 cells using 3'-end and full-length RNA preparation methods.
                 Our results confirm that the conservation process did not
                 alter transcriptional profiles. This substantially broadens
                 the scope of applications in single-cell transcriptomics and

                 tissues like the pancreas, because reliable markers are

                 FACS, robotics, and the CEL-Seq2 protocol to obtain the

              in a highly parallel and cost-effective way. A critical and often
              limiting step is the preparation of cells in an unperturbed
              state, not compromised by stress or ageing. This can be
              particularly challenging during prolonged handling or transport,
              or when cells are rare and need to be collected over several
              days. Here, we tested whether chemical fixation can be used to
              overcome these problems. Methanol fixation allowed us to
              stabilize and preserve dissociated cells for several weeks. Fixed
              cells contained intact RNA and enabled high quality cDNA library
              generation. By using mixtures of fixed human and mouse cells, we
              showed that individual transcriptomes could be confidently

              measurements from live and fixed samples were highly correlated

                 digital measure of the presence and prevalence of transcripts

                 transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of
                 transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude.
                 Although >90\% of uniquely mapped reads fell within known

                 transcript profiles and covariates from a set of individuals,

                 providing prior information about which genes are involved in

                 such as batch effects can dramatically reduce the accuracy of
                 statistical inference in genomic experiments. These sources of
                 noise must be modeled and removed to accurately measure
                 biological variability and to obtain correct statistical
                 inference when performing high-throughput genomic analysis. We
                 introduced surrogate variable analysis (sva) for estimating
                 these artifacts by (i) identifying the part of the genomic
                 data only affected by artifacts and (ii) estimating the
                 artifacts with principal components or singular vectors of the
                 subset of the data matrix. The resulting estimates of
                 artifacts can be used in subsequent analyses as adjustment
                 factors to correct analyses. Here I describe a version of the
                 sva approach specifically created for count data or FPKMs from
                 sequencing experiments based on appropriate data

                 difficult to estimate due to problems of synchronization,
                 temporal sampling and rate heterogeneity. Methods are needed
                 that can utilize multi-dimensional data, such as those
                 resulting from DNA microarray experiments, in order to
                 reconstruct time series from unordered or poorly ordered sets
                 of observations. RESULTS: We present a set of algorithms for
                 estimating temporal orderings from unordered sets of sample
                 elements. The techniques we describe are based on
                 modifications of a minimum-spanning tree calculated from a
                 weighted, undirected graph. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
                 approach by applying these techniques to an artificial data
                 set as well as several gene expression data sets derived from
                 DNA microarray experiments. In addition to estimating
                 orderings, the techniques we describe also provide useful
                 heuristics for assessing relevant properties of sample
                 datasets such as noise and sampling intensity, and we show how
                 a data structure called a PQ-tree can be used to represent
                 uncertainty in a reconstructed ordering. AVAILABILITY:
                 Academic implementations of the ordering algorithms are

              limitations when resolving complex or similar sets of isoforms.
              As a result, estimates of isoform abundance carry far more
              uncertainty than those made at the gene level. When confronted
              with this uncertainty, commonly used methods produce estimates
              that are often high-variance\textbackslash---|small perturbations
              in the data often produce dramatically different results,

              Isolator, which analyzes all samples in an experiment in unison
              using a simple Bayesian hierarchical model. Combined with
              aggressive bias correction, it produces estimates that are
              simultaneously accurate and show high agreement between samples.
              In a comprehensive comparison of accuracy and variance, we show
              that this property is unique to Isolator. We further demonstrate
              that the approach of modeling an entire experiment enables new

                 one parental allele. However, it has remained controversial
                 whether, or to what degree, random monoallelic expression of
                 autosomal genes (aRME) is mitotically inherited (clonal) or
                 stochastic (dynamic) in somatic cells, particularly in vivo.

                 overwhelming majority of aRME occurs transiently within
                 individual cells, and patterns of aRME are thus primarily
                 scattered throughout somatic cell populations rather than, as

                 biological variation significantly exceeding technical noise

                 high-throughput analysis and sorting of single cells.
                 Compartmentalization of single cells in droplets enables the
                 analysis of proteins released from or secreted by cells,
                 thereby overcoming one of the major limitations of traditional
                 flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. As an
                 example of this approach, we detail a binding assay for
                 detecting antibodies secreted from single mouse hybridoma
                 cells. Secreted antibodies are detected after only 15 min by
                 co-compartmentalizing single mouse hybridoma cells, a
                 fluorescent probe and single beads coated with anti-mouse IgG
                 antibodies in 50-pl droplets. The beads capture the secreted
                 antibodies and, when the captured antibodies bind to the
                 probe, the fluorescence becomes localized on the beads,
                 generating a clearly distinguishable fluorescence signal that
                 enables droplet sorting at ∼200 Hz as well as cell enrichment.
                 The microfluidic system described is easily adapted for
                 screening other intracellular, cell-surface or secreted
                 proteins and for quantifying catalytic or regulatory
                 activities. In order to screen ∼1 million cells, the
                 microfluidic operations require 2-6 h; the entire process,
                 including preparation of microfluidic devices and mammalian
                 cells, requires 5-7 d.",

                 simultaneously or single cells, for which the exact in vivo or
                 in situ position is unknown. Although cellular heterogeneity
                 can be discerned when analyzing single cells, any spatially
                 defined attributes that underpin the heterogeneous nature of

                 sequencing are ideally suited for discovering novel candidate
                 genes, they are unable to yield spatially resolved information
                 in embryos or tissues. Microscopy-based approaches, using in
                 situ hybridization, for example, can provide spatial

  abstract    = "Image-based approaches to single-cell transcriptomics, in
                 which RNA species are identified and counted in situ via
                 imaging, have emerged as a powerful complement to single-cell
                 methods based on RNA sequencing of dissociated cells. These
                 image-based approaches naturally preserve the native spatial
                 context of RNAs within a cell and the organization of cells
                 within tissue, which are important for addressing many
                 biological questions. However, the throughput of these
                 image-based approaches is relatively low. Here we report
                 advances that lead to a drastic increase in the measurement
                 throughput of multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ
                 hybridization (MERFISH), an image-based approach to
                 single-cell transcriptomics. In MERFISH, RNAs are identified
                 via a combinatorial labeling approach that encodes RNA species
                 with error-robust barcodes followed by sequential rounds of
                 single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) to
                 read out these barcodes. Here we increase the throughput of
                 MERFISH by two orders of magnitude through a combination of
                 improvements, including using chemical cleavage instead of
                 photobleaching to remove fluorescent signals between
                 consecutive rounds of smFISH imaging, increasing the imaging
                 field of view, and using multicolor imaging. With these
                 improvements, we performed RNA profiling in more than 100,000

                 Here we present Wishbone, an algorithm for positioning single
                 cells along bifurcating developmental trajectories with high
                 resolution. Wishbone uses multi-dimensional single-cell data,
                 such as mass cytometry or RNA-Seq data, as input and orders
                 cells according to their developmental progression, and it
                 pinpoints bifurcation points by labeling each cell as
                 pre-bifurcation or as one of two post-bifurcation cell fates.
                 Using 30-channel mass cytometry data, we show that Wishbone
                 accurately recovers the known stages of T-cell development in

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The analysis of gene expression from time series
                 underpins many biological studies. Two basic forms of analysis
                 recur for data of this type: removing inactive (quiet) genes
                 from the study and determining which genes are differentially
                 expressed. Often these analysis stages are applied
                 disregarding the fact that the data is drawn from a time
                 series. In this paper we propose a simple model for accounting
                 for the underlying temporal nature of the data based on a
                 Gaussian process. RESULTS: We review Gaussian process (GP)
                 regression for estimating the continuous trajectories
                 underlying in gene expression time-series. We present a simple
                 approach which can be used to filter quiet genes, or for the
                 case of time series in the form of expression ratios, quantify
                 differential expression. We assess via ROC curves the rankings
                 produced by our regression framework and compare them to a
                 recently proposed hierarchical Bayesian model for the analysis
                 of gene expression time-series (BATS). We compare on both
                 simulated and experimental data showing that the proposed
                 approach considerably outperforms the current state of the
                 art. CONCLUSIONS: Gaussian processes offer an attractive
                 trade-off between efficiency and usability for the analysis of
                 microarray time series. The Gaussian process framework offers
                 a natural way of handling biological replicates and missing
                 values and provides confidence intervals along the estimated
                 curves of gene expression. Therefore, we believe Gaussian
                 processes should be a standard tool in the analysis of gene
                 expression time series.",

                 cell with a 'pseudotime' where true time series
                 experimentation is too difficult to perform. However, owing to
                 the high variability in gene expression between individual

              emerged as a powerful tool for understanding how gene regulation
              governs cell fate decisions. However, learning the structure of
              complex single-cell trajectories with two or more branches
              remains a challenging computational problem. We present Monocle
              2, which uses reversed graph embedding to reconstruct single-cell
              trajectories in a fully unsupervised manner. Monocle 2 learns an
              explicit principal graph to describe the data, greatly improving
              the robustness and accuracy of its trajectories compared to other
              algorithms. Monocle 2 uncovered a new, alternative cell fate in
              what we previously reported to be a linear trajectory for
              differentiating myoblasts. We also reconstruct branched
              trajectories for two studies of blood development, and show that
              loss of function mutations in key lineage transcription factors
              diverts cells to alternative branches on the a trajectory.
              Monocle 2 is thus a powerful tool for analyzing cell fate
              decisions with single-cell genomics.",

                 individual sequencing libraries is expensive and
                 time-consuming. Tagmentation-based library construction, using
                 the Tn5 transposase, is efficient for generating sequencing

                 single-cell RNA-seq protocol to study the reference
                 lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878. By using spike-in

                 RNA molecules per cell for each gene and find significant
                 variation in total mRNA content: between 50,000 and 300,000
                 transcripts per cell. We directly measure technical
                 stochasticity by a pool/split design and find that there are

  abstract    = "A tradeoff between precision and throughput constrains all
                 biological measurements, including sequencing-based
                 technologies. Here, we develop a mathematical framework that
                 defines this tradeoff between mRNA-sequencing depth and error
                 in the extraction of biological information. We find that
                 transcriptional programs can be reproducibly identified at 1\%
                 of conventional read depths. We demonstrate that this
                 resilience to noise of ``shallow'' sequencing derives from a
                 natural property, low dimensionality, which is a fundamental
                 feature of gene expression data. Accordingly, our conclusions
                 hold for ∼350 single-cell and bulk gene expression datasets
                 across yeast, mouse, and human. In total, our approach
                 provides quantitative guidelines for the choice of sequencing
                 depth necessary to achieve a desired level of analytical
                 resolution. We codify these guidelines in an open-source read
                 depth calculator. This work demonstrates that the structure

  abstract = "Conventional methods for profiling the molecular content of
              biological samples fail to resolve heterogeneity that is present
              at the level of single cells. In the past few years, single cell
              RNA sequencing has emerged as a powerful strategy for overcoming
              this challenge. However, its adoption has been limited by a
              paucity of methods that are at once simple to implement and cost
              effective to scale massively. Here, we describe a combinatorial
              indexing strategy to profile the transcriptomes of large numbers
              of single cells or single nuclei without requiring the physical
              isolation of each cell (Single cell Combinatorial Indexing
              RNA-seq or sci-RNA-seq). We show that sci-RNA-seq can be used to
              efficiently profile the transcriptomes of tens-of-thousands of
              single cells per experiment, and demonstrate that we can stratify
              cell types from these data. Key advantages of sci-RNA-seq over
              contemporary alternatives such as droplet-based single cell
              RNA-seq include sublinear cost scaling, a reliance on widely
              available reagents and equipment, the ability to concurrently
              process many samples within a single workflow, compatibility with
              methanol fixation of cells, cell capture based on DNA content
              rather than cell size, and the flexibility to profile either
              cells or nuclei. As a demonstration of sci-RNA-seq, we profile
              the transcriptomes of 42,035 single cells from C. elegans at the
              L2 stage, effectively 50-fold ``shotgun cellular coverage'' of
              the somatic cell composition of this organism at this stage. We
              identify 27 distinct cell types, including rare cell types such
              as the two distal tip cells of the developing gonad, estimate
              consensus expression profiles and define cell-type specific and
              selective genes. Given that C. elegans is the only organism with
              a fully mapped cellular lineage, these data represent a rich
              resource for future methods aimed at defining cell types and
              states. They will advance our understanding of developmental
              biology, and constitute a major leap towards a comprehensive,
              single-cell molecular atlas of a whole animal.",

              require a collective effort to characterize billions of
              individual cells. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has
              emerged as the main tool for characterizing cellular diversity,
              but current methods use custom microfluidics or microwells to
              compartmentalize single cells, limiting scalability and
              widespread adoption. Here we present Split Pool Ligation-based
              Transcriptome sequencing (SPLiT-seq), a scRNA-seq method that
              labels the cellular origin of RNA through combinatorial indexing.
              SPLiT-seq is compatible with fixed cells, scales exponentially,
              uses only basic laboratory equipment, and costs one cent per
              cell. We used this approach to analyze 109,069 single cell
              transcriptomes from an entire postnatal day 5 mouse brain,
              providing the first global snapshot at this stage of development.
              We identified 13 main populations comprising different types of
              neurons, glia, immune cells, endothelia, as well as types in the
              blood-brain-barrier. Moreover, we resolve substructure within
              these clusters corresponding to cells at different stages of
              development. As sequencing capacity increases, SPLiT-seq will
              enable profiling of billions of cells in a single experiment.",

                 diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical
                 screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a
                 biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated
                 classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging
                 task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance
                 of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
                 show potential for general and highly variable tasks across
                 many fine-grained object categories. Here we demonstrate
                 classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained
                 end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease
                 labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of 129,450
                 clinical images-two orders of magnitude larger than previous
                 datasets-consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its
                 performance against 21 board-certified dermatologists on
                 biopsy-proven clinical images with two critical binary
                 classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus
                 benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus
                 benign nevi. The first case represents the identification of
                 the most common cancers, the second represents the
                 identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves
                 performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks,
                 demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of
                 classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable
                 to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile
                 devices can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists
                 outside of the clinic. It is projected that 6.3 billion

              exciting possibilities to address biological and medical
              questions, but a systematic comparison of recently developed
              protocols is still lacking. Results: We generated data from 447
              mouse embryonic stem cells using Drop‑seq, SCRB‑seq, Smart‑seq
              (on Fluidigm C1) and Smart‑seq2 and analyzed existing data from
              35 mouse embryonic stem cells prepared with CEL‑seq. We find that
              Smart‑seq2 is the most sensitive method as it detects the most
              genes per cell and across cells. However, it shows more
              amplification noise than CEL‑seq, Drop‑seq and SCRB‑seq as it
              cannot use unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). We use
              simulations to model how the observed combinations of sensitivity
              and amplification noise affects detection of differentially
              expressed genes and find that SCRB‑seq reaches 80\% power with
              the fewest number of cells. When considering cost-efficiency at
              different sequencing depths at 80\% power, we find that Drop‑seq
              is preferable when quantifying transcriptomes of a large numbers
              of cells with low sequencing depth, SCRB‑seq is preferable when
              quantifying transcriptomes of fewer cells and Smart‑seq2 is
              preferable when annotating and/or quantifying transcriptomes of
              fewer cells as long one can use in-house produced transposase.
              Conclusions: Our analyses allows an informed choice among five
              prominent scRNA‑seq protocols and provides a solid framework for
              benchmarking future improvements in scRNA‑seq methodologies.",

  abstract    = "MOTIVATION: The alignment of sequencing reads to a
                 transcriptome is a common and important step in many RNA-seq
                 analysis tasks. When aligning RNA-seq reads directly to a
                 transcriptome (as is common in the de novo setting or when a
                 trusted reference annotation is available), care must be taken
                 to report the potentially large number of multi-mapping
                 locations per read. This can pose a substantial computational
                 burden for existing aligners, and can considerably slow
                 downstream analysis. RESULTS: We introduce a novel concept,
                 quasi-mapping, and an efficient algorithm implementing this
                 approach for mapping sequencing reads to a transcriptome. By
                 attempting only to report the potential loci of origin of a
                 sequencing read, and not the base-to-base alignment by which
                 it derives from the reference, RapMap-our tool implementing
                 quasi-mapping-is capable of mapping sequencing reads to a
                 target transcriptome substantially faster than existing
                 alignment tools. The algorithm we use to implement
                 quasi-mapping uses several efficient data structures and takes
                 advantage of the special structure of shared sequence
                 prevalent in transcriptomes to rapidly provide highly-accurate
                 mapping information. We demonstrate how quasi-mapping can be
                 successfully applied to the problems of transcript-level
                 quantification from RNA-seq reads and the clustering of
                 contigs from de novo assembled transcriptomes into
                 biologically meaningful groups. AVAILABILITY AND

                   statistician, focusing on regression problems. Our system
                   explores an open-ended space of statistical models to
                   discover a good explanation of a data set, and then produces

                   Our approach treats unknown regression functions
                   nonparametrically using Gaussian processes, which has two
                   important consequences. First, Gaussian processes can model
                   functions in terms of high-level properties (e.g.
                   smoothness, trends, periodicity, changepoints). Taken
                   together with the compositional structure of our language of
                   models this allows us to automatically describe functions in
                   simple terms. Second, the use of flexible nonparametric
                   models and a rich language for composing them in an
                   open-ended manner also results in state-of-the-art

  abstract    = "MOTIVATION: Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing
                 (HTS) have made it possible to monitor genomes in great
                 detail. New experiments not only use HTS to measure genomic
                 features at one time point but also monitor them changing over
                 time with the aim of identifying significant changes in their
                 abundance. In population genetics, for example, allele
                 frequencies are monitored over time to detect significant
                 frequency changes that indicate selection pressures. Previous
                 attempts at analyzing data from HTS experiments have been
                 limited as they could not simultaneously include data at
                 intermediate time points, replicate experiments and sources of
                 uncertainty specific to HTS such as sequencing depth. RESULTS:
                 We present the beta-binomial Gaussian process model for
                 ranking features with significant non-random variation in
                 abundance over time. The features are assumed to represent
                 proportions, such as proportion of an alternative allele in a
                 population. We use the beta-binomial model to capture the
                 uncertainty arising from finite sequencing depth and combine
                 it with a Gaussian process model over the time series. In
                 simulations that mimic the features of experimental evolution
                 data, the proposed method clearly outperforms classical
                 testing in average precision of finding selected alleles. We
                 also present simulations exploring different experimental
                 design choices and results on real data from Drosophila
                 experimental evolution experiment in temperature adaptation.

                 differentiation efficiencies, we propose a method to rescale
                 the dynamics between replicated measurements. We develop an
                 MCMC sampling method to make inference of differential
                 expression dynamics between conditions. DyNB identifies
                 several known and novel genes involved in Th17
                 differentiation. Analysis of differentiation efficiencies
                 revealed consistent patterns in gene expression dynamics
                 between different cultures. We use qRT-PCR to validate
                 differential expression and differentiation efficiencies for
                 selected genes. Comparison of the results with those obtained
                 via traditional timepoint-: wise analysis shows that
                 time-course analysis together with time rescaling between
                 cultures identifies differentially expressed genes which would
                 not otherwise be detected. AVAILABILITY: An implementation of

                 have become increasingly common. Typically, a latent
                 trajectory corresponding to a biological process of interest -
                 such as differentiation or cell cycle - is discovered.
                 However, relatively little attention has been paid to
                 modelling the differential expression of genes along such
                 trajectories. RESULTS: We present switchde, a statistical
                 framework and accompanying R package for identifying
                 switch-like differential expression of genes along
                 pseudotemporal trajectories. Our method includes fast model
                 fitting that provides interpretable parameter estimates
                 corresponding to how quickly a gene is up or down regulated as
                 well as where in the trajectory such regulation occurs. It
                 also reports a p-value in favour of rejecting a
                 constant-expression model for switch-like differential
                 expression and optionally models the zero-inflation prevalent

                 (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in
                 the near future for many functional genomics applications. One
                 of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene
                 expression studies, involves determining whether there is
                 evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are
                 significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR
                 is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential
                 expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson
                 model is used to account for both biological and technical
                 variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the
                 degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the
                 reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even
                 with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least
                 one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The
                 software may have other applications beyond sequencing data,

                 integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression
                 experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex
                 experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome
                 the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma
                 has been a popular choice for gene discovery through
                 differential expression analyses of microarray and
                 high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly
                 strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such
                 data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been
                 significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the
                 package can now perform both differential expression and
                 differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
                 data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted
                 to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well.
                 These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and
                 microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the
                 package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise
                 expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression
                 profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of
                 higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced
                 possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression
                 differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of
                 the limma package, summarizing both new and historical
                 features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features

                 expression is important and will be of much interest in the

                 identifying differentially expressed genes in a time course

                 time course microarray studies that can be applied to the
                 typical types of comparisons and sampling schemes. This method
                 is applied to two studies on humans. In one study, genes are
                 identified that show differential expression over time in
                 response to in vivo endotoxin administration. By using our
                 method, 7,409 genes are called significant at a 1\%
                 false-discovery rate level, whereas several existing
                 approaches fail to identify any genes. In another study, 417
                 genes are identified at a 10\% false-discovery rate level that
                 show expression changing with age in the kidney cortex. Here
                 it is also shown that as many as 47\% of the genes change with
                 age in a manner more complex than simple exponential growth or
                 decay. The methodology proposed here has been implemented in

                 sequencing are ideally suited for discovering novel candidate
                 genes, they are unable to yield spatially resolved information
                 in embryos or tissues. Microscopy-based approaches, using in
                 situ hybridization, for example, can provide spatial

  abstract    = "Olfactory sensory neurons express just one out of a possible ∼
                 1,000 odorant receptor genes, reflecting an exquisite mode of
                 gene regulation. In one model, once an odorant receptor is
                 chosen for expression, other receptor genes are suppressed by
                 a negative feedback mechanism, ensuring a stable functional
                 identity of the sensory neuron for the lifetime of the cell.
                 The signal transduction mechanism subserving odorant receptor
                 gene silencing remains obscure, however. Here, we demonstrate
                 in the zebrafish that odorant receptor gene silencing is
                 dependent on receptor activity. Moreover, we show that
                 signaling through G protein $\beta$$\gamma$ subunits is both
                 necessary and sufficient to suppress the expression of odorant
                 receptor genes and likely acts through histone methylation to
                 maintain the silenced odorant receptor genes in
                 transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin. These results link
                 receptor activity with the epigenetic mechanisms responsible

  abstract = "A number of problems in probability and statistics can be
              addressed using the multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution.
              In the one-dimensional case, computing the probability for a
              given mean and variance simply requires the evaluation of the
              corresponding Gaussian density. In the n-dimensional setting,
              however, it requires the inversion of an n $\times$n covariance
              matrix, C, as well as the evaluation of its determinant, det(C).
              In many cases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the
              covariance matrix is of the form C = $\sigma$(2) I + K, where K
              is computed using a specified covariance kernel which depends on
              the data and additional parameters (hyperparameters). The matrix
              C is typically dense, causing standard direct methods for
              inversion and determinant evaluation to require O(n(3)) work.
              This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling. Here, we show
              that for the most commonly used covariance functions, the matrix
              C can be hierarchically factored into a product of block low-rank
              updates of the identity matrix, yielding an O (n log(2) n)
              algorithm for inversion. More importantly, we show that this
              factorization enables the evaluation of the determinant det(C),
              permitting the direct calculation of probabilities in high
              dimensions under fairly broad assumptions on the kernel defining
              K. Our fast algorithm brings many problems in marginalization and
              the adaptation of hyperparameters within practical reach using a
              single CPU core. The combination of nearly optimal scaling in
              terms of problem size with high-performance computing resources
              will permit the modeling of previously intractable problems. We
              illustrate the performance of the scheme on standard covariance
              kernels.",

  abstract    = "Mouse studies have been instrumental in forming our current
                 understanding of early cell-lineage decisions; however,
                 similar insights into the early human development are severely
                 limited. Here, we present a comprehensive transcriptional map
                 of human embryo development, including the sequenced
                 transcriptomes of 1,529 individual cells from 88 human
                 preimplantation embryos. These data show that cells undergo an
                 intermediate state of co-expression of lineage-specific genes,
                 followed by a concurrent establishment of the trophectoderm,
                 epiblast, and primitive endoderm lineages, which coincide with
                 blastocyst formation. Female cells of all three lineages
                 achieve dosage compensation of X chromosome RNA levels prior
                 to implantation. However, in contrast to the mouse, XIST is
                 transcribed from both alleles throughout the progression of
                 this expression dampening, and X chromosome genes maintain
                 biallelic expression while dosage compensation proceeds. We
                 envision broad utility of this transcriptional atlas in future
                 studies on human development as well as in stem cell research.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: PolyA- RNAs have not been widely analyzed in human
                 pre-implantation embryos due to the scarcity of materials. In
                 particular, circular RNA (circRNA), a novel type of polyA-
                 RNA, has not been characterized during human pre-implantation
                 development. RESULTS: We systematically analyze polyA+
                 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and polyA- RNAs in individual human
                 oocytes and pre-implantation embryos using SUPeR-seq. We de
                 novo identify 10,032 circRNAs from 2974 hosting genes. Most of
                 these circRNAs are developmentally stage-specific and
                 dynamically regulated. Many of them are maternally expressed,
                 implying their potentially important regulatory functions in
                 oogenesis and the formation of totipotent zygotes. Comparison
                 between human and mouse embryos reveals both high conservation
                 and clear distinction between these two species. Human
                 pre-implantation embryos generate more types of circRNA
                 compared with mouse embryos and this is associated with a
                 striking increase of the length of the circRNA flanking
                 introns in humans. We also perform RNA de novo assembly and
                 identify novel transcript units, many of which are potentially
                 novel long non-coding RNAs. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports
                 the first analysis of the whole transcriptome comprising both
                 polyA+ mRNAs and polyA- RNAs including circRNAs during human
                 pre-implantation development. It provides an invaluable
                 resource for analyzing the unique function and complex
                 regulatory mechanisms of circRNAs during this process.",

  abstract    = "Several recent studies link parental environments to
                 phenotypes in subsequent generations. In this work, we
                 investigate the mechanism by which paternal diet affects
                 offspring metabolism. Protein restriction in mice affects
                 small RNA (sRNA) levels in mature sperm, with decreased let-7
                 levels and increased amounts of 5' fragments of glycine
                 transfer RNAs (tRNAs). In testicular sperm, tRNA fragments are
                 scarce but increase in abundance as sperm mature in the
                 epididymis. Epididymosomes (vesicles that fuse with sperm
                 during epididymal transit) carry RNA payloads matching those
                 of mature sperm and can deliver RNAs to immature sperm in
                 vitro. Functionally, tRNA-glycine-GCC fragments repress genes
                 associated with the endogenous retroelement MERVL, in both
                 embryonic stem cells and embryos. Our results shed light on
                 sRNA biogenesis and its dietary regulation during
                 posttesticular sperm maturation, and they also link tRNA
                 fragments to regulation of endogenous retroelements active in
                 the preimplantation embryo.",

                 comprehensive atlas of human cells. At the same time, it has
                 reopened definitions of a cell's identity and of the ways in
                 which identity is regulated by the cell's molecular circuitry.
                 Emerging computational analysis methods, especially in
                 single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), have already begun to
                 reveal, in a data-driven way, the diverse simultaneous facets
                 of a cell's identity, from discrete cell types to continuous
                 dynamic transitions and spatial locations. These developments
                 will eventually allow a cell to be represented as a
                 superposition of 'basis vectors', each determining a different
                 (but possibly dependent) aspect of cellular organization and
                 function. However, computational methods must also overcome
                 considerable challenges-from handling technical noise and data
                 scale to forming new abstractions of biology. As the scale of
                 single-cell experiments continues to increase, new
                 computational approaches will be essential for constructing
                 and characterizing a reference map of cell identities.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The analysis of gene expression from time series
                 underpins many biological studies. Two basic forms of analysis
                 recur for data of this type: removing inactive (quiet) genes
                 from the study and determining which genes are differentially
                 expressed. Often these analysis stages are applied
                 disregarding the fact that the data is drawn from a time
                 series. In this paper we propose a simple model for accounting
                 for the underlying temporal nature of the data based on a
                 Gaussian process. RESULTS: We review Gaussian process (GP)
                 regression for estimating the continuous trajectories
                 underlying in gene expression time-series. We present a simple
                 approach which can be used to filter quiet genes, or for the
                 case of time series in the form of expression ratios, quantify
                 differential expression. We assess via ROC curves the rankings
                 produced by our regression framework and compare them to a
                 recently proposed hierarchical Bayesian model for the analysis
                 of gene expression time-series (BATS). We compare on both
                 simulated and experimental data showing that the proposed
                 approach considerably outperforms the current state of the
                 art. CONCLUSIONS: Gaussian processes offer an attractive
                 trade-off between efficiency and usability for the analysis of
                 microarray time series. The Gaussian process framework offers
                 a natural way of handling biological replicates and missing
                 values and provides confidence intervals along the estimated
                 curves of gene expression. Therefore, we believe Gaussian
                 processes should be a standard tool in the analysis of gene
                 expression time series.",

                 reverse-transcribed cDNA copy of their genome, a ``provirus'',
                 into the genome of their host. If the infected cell belongs to
                 the germline, the integrated provirus can become ``fixed''
                 within the host genome as an endogenous retrovirus and be
                 transmitted vertically to the progeny in a Mendelian fashion.
                 Based on the numerous proviral sequences that are recovered
                 within the genomic DNA of vertebrates--up to ten percent in
                 the case of mammals--such events must have occurred repeatedly
                 during the course of millions of years of evolution. Although
                 most of the ancient proviral sequences have been disrupted, a
                 few ``endogenized'' retroviral genes are conserved and still
                 encode functional proteins. In this review, we focus on the
                 recent discovery of genes derived from the envelope
                 glycoprotein-encoding (env) genes of endogenous retroviruses
                 that have been domesticated by mammals to carry out an
                 essential function in placental development. They were called
                 syncytins based on the membrane fusogenic capacity that they
                 have kept from their parental env gene and which contributes
                 to the formation of the placental fused cell layer called the
                 syncytiotrophoblast, at the materno-fetal interface.
                 Remarkably, the capture of syncytin or syncytin-like genes,
                 sometimes as pairs, was found to have occurred independently
                 from different endogenous retroviruses in diverse mammalian
                 lineages such as primates--including humans--, muroids,
                 leporids, carnivores, caviids, and ovis, between around 10 and
                 85 million years ago. Knocking out one or both mouse
                 syncytin-A and -B genes provided evidence that they indeed
                 play a critical role in placentation. We discuss the
                 possibility that the immunosuppressive domain embedded within
                 retroviral envelope glycoproteins and conserved in syncytin
                 proteins, may be involved in the tolerance of the fetus by the
                 maternal immune system. Finally, we speculate that the capture
                 of a founding syncytin-like gene could have been instrumental
                 in the dramatic transition from egg-laying to placental
                 mammals.",

                 mouse development from the eight-cell stage to
                 postimplantation using lineage-specific RNA sequencing. This
                 method combines high sensitivity and reporter-based fate
                 assignment to acquire the full spectrum of gene expression
                 from discrete embryonic cell types. We define expression
                 modules indicative of developmental state and temporal
                 regulatory patterns marking the establishment and dissolution
                 of naive pluripotency in vivo. Analysis of embryonic stem
                 cells and diapaused embryos reveals near-complete conservation
                 of the core transcriptional circuitry operative in the
                 preimplantation epiblast. Comparison to inner cell masses of
                 marmoset primate blastocysts identifies a similar complement
                 of pluripotency factors but use of alternative signaling
                 pathways. Embryo culture experiments further indicate that
                 marmoset embryos utilize WNT signaling during early lineage
                 segregation, unlike rodents. These findings support a
                 conserved transcription factor foundation for naive

  abstract    = "Initiation of zygotic transcription in mammals is poorly
                 understood. In mice, zygotic transcription is first detected
                 shortly after pronucleus formation in 1-cell embryos, but the
                 identity of the transcribed loci and mechanisms regulating
                 their expression are not known. Using total RNA-Seq, we have
                 found that transcription in 1-cell embryos is highly
                 promiscuous, such that intergenic regions are extensively
                 expressed and thousands of genes are transcribed at comparably
                 low levels. Striking is that transcription can occur in the
                 absence of defined core-promoter elements. Furthermore,
                 accumulation of translatable zygotic mRNAs is minimal in
                 1-cell embryos because of inefficient splicing and 3'
                 processing of nascent transcripts. These findings provide
                 novel insights into regulation of gene expression in 1-cell
                 mouse embryos that may confer a protective mechanism against
                 precocious gene expression that is the product of a relaxed
                 chromatin structure present in 1-cell embryos. The results
                 also suggest that the first zygotic transcription itself is an
                 active component of chromatin remodeling in 1-cell embryos.",

  abstract    = "Pluripotency, differentiation, and X Chromosome inactivation
                 (XCI) are key aspects of embryonic development. However, the
                 underlying relationship and mechanisms among these processes
                 remain unclear. Here, we systematically dissected these
                 features along developmental progression using mouse embryonic
                 stem cells (mESCs) and single-cell RNA sequencing with allelic
                 resolution. We found that mESCs grown in a ground state 2i
                 condition displayed transcriptomic profiles diffused from
                 preimplantation mouse embryonic cells, whereas EpiStem cells
                 closely resembled the post-implantation epiblast. Sex-related
                 gene expression varied greatly across distinct developmental
                 states. We also identified novel markers that were highly
                 enriched in each developmental state. Moreover, we revealed
                 that several novel pathways, including PluriNetWork and Focal
                 Adhesion, were responsible for the delayed progression of
                 female EpiStem cells. Importantly, we ``digitalized'' XCI
                 progression using allelic expression of active and inactive X
                 Chromosomes and surprisingly found that XCI states exhibited
                 profound variability in each developmental state, including
                 the 2i condition. XCI progression was not tightly synchronized
                 with loss of pluripotency and increase of differentiation at
                 the single-cell level, although these processes were globally
                 correlated. In addition, highly expressed genes, including
                 core pluripotency factors, were in general biallelically
                 expressed. Taken together, our study sheds light on the
                 dynamics of XCI progression and the asynchronicity between
                 pluripotency, differentiation, and XCI.",

                 a histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation demethylase, functions as
                 a barrier for two-cell arrest of cloned embryos. Moreover, we
                 discovered that inactivation of another histone demethylase
                 Kdm5b accounts for the arrest of cloned embryos at the
                 four-cell stage through single-cell analysis. Co-injection of
                 Kdm4b and Kdm5b can restore transcriptional profiles of
                 somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos and greatly improve the
                 blastocyst development (over 95\%) as well as the production
                 of cloned mice. Our study therefore provides an effective
                 approach to identify key factors responsible for the
                 developmental arrest of somatic cell cloned embryos.",

              landscape and its dynamics in this period remain unexplored. Here
              we report a genome-wide map of accessible chromatin in mouse
              preimplantation embryos using an improved assay for
              transposase-accessible chromatin with high throughput sequencing
              (ATAC-seq) approach with CRISPR/Cas9-assisted mitochondrial DNA
              depletion. We show that despite extensive parental asymmetry in
              DNA methylomes, the chromatin accessibility between the parental
              genomes is globally comparable after major zygotic genome
              activation (ZGA). Accessible chromatin in early embryos is widely
              shaped by transposable elements and overlaps extensively with
              putative cis-regulatory sequences. Unexpectedly, accessible
              chromatin is also found near the transcription end sites of
              active genes. By integrating the maps of cis-regulatory elements

              network of early development, which helps to identify the key
              modulators for lineage specification. Finally, we find that the
              activities of cis-regulatory elements and their associated open
              chromatin diminished before major ZGA. Surprisingly, we observed
              many loci showing non-canonical, large open chromatin domains

              presence of an unusually permissive chromatin state. Together,

                 development is unknown. Here we performed single cell RNA-Seq
                 analysis of single blastomeres of mouse embryos, which
                 revealed significant changes in the transcriptome.
                 Importantly, over half of the transcripts with detectable
                 genetic polymorphisms exhibit ASE, most notably, individual
                 blastomeres from the same two-cell embryo show similar pattern

                 expressed along time is an important task in two-sample time
                 course experiments. Furthermore, estimating at which time
                 periods the differential expression is present can provide
                 additional insight into temporal gene functions. The current
                 differential detection methods are designed to detect
                 difference along observation time intervals or on single
                 measurement points, warranting dense measurements along time
                 to characterize the full temporal differential expression
                 patterns. RESULTS: We propose a novel Bayesian likelihood
                 ratio test to estimate the differential expression time
                 periods. Applying the ratio test to systems of genes provides
                 the temporal response timings and durations of gene expression
                 to a biological condition. We introduce a novel non-stationary
                 Gaussian process as the underlying expression model, with
                 major improvements on model fitness on perturbation and stress
                 experiments. The method is robust to uneven or sparse
                 measurements along time. We assess the performance of the
                 method on realistically simulated dataset and compare against
                 state-of-the-art methods. We additionally apply the method to
                 the analysis of primary human endothelial cells under an
                 ionizing radiation stress to study the transcriptional
                 perturbations over 283 measured genes in an attempt to better
                 understand the role of endothelium in both normal and cancer
                 tissues during radiotherapy. As a result, using the cascade of
                 differential expression periods, domain literature and gene
                 enrichment analysis, we gain insights into the dynamic
                 response of endothelial cells to irradiation. AVAILABILITY AND

  abstract    = "MOTIVATION: RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments now span
                 hundreds to thousands of samples. Current spliced alignment
                 software is designed to analyze each sample separately.
                 Consequently, no information is gained from analyzing multiple
                 samples together, and it requires extra work to obtain
                 analysis products that incorporate data from across samples.
                 RESULTS: We describe Rail-RNA, a cloud-enabled spliced aligner
                 that analyzes many samples at once. Rail-RNA eliminates
                 redundant work across samples, making it more efficient as
                 samples are added. For many samples, Rail-RNA is more accurate
                 than annotation-assisted aligners. We use Rail-RNA to align
                 667 RNA-seq samples from the GEUVADIS project on Amazon Web
                 Services in under 16 hours for US\$0.91 per sample. Rail-RNA
                 outputs alignments in SAM/BAM format; but it also outputs (1)
                 base-level coverage bigWigs for each sample; (2) coverage
                 bigWigs encoding normalized mean and median coverages at each
                 base across samples analyzed; and (3) exon-exon splice
                 junctions and indels (features) in columnar formats that
                 juxtapose coverages in samples in which a given feature is
                 found. Supplementary outputs are ready for use with downstream
                 packages for reproducible statistical analysis.We use Rail-RNA
                 to identify expressed regions in the GEUVADIS samples and show
                 that both annotated and unannotated (novel) expressed regions
                 exhibit consistent patterns of variation across populations
                 and with respect to known confounding variables. AVAILABILITY:

              utilization of assigned spectrum ranges from 15\% to 85\% with a

  abstract      = "Many scientific datasets are of high dimension, and the
                   analysis usually requires visual manipulation by retaining
                   the most important structures of data. Principal curve is a
                   widely used approach for this purpose. However, many
                   existing methods work only for data with structures that are
                   not self-intersected, which is quite restrictive for real
                   applications. A few methods can overcome the above problem,
                   but they either require complicated human-made rules for a
                   specific task with lack of convergence guarantee and
                   adaption flexibility to different tasks, or cannot obtain
                   explicit structures of data. To address these issues, we
                   develop a new regularized principal graph learning framework
                   that captures the local information of the underlying graph
                   structure based on reversed graph embedding. As showcases,
                   models that can learn a spanning tree or a weighted
                   undirected $\ell_1$ graph are proposed, and a new learning
                   algorithm is developed that learns a set of principal points
                   and a graph structure from data, simultaneously. The new
                   algorithm is simple with guaranteed convergence. We then
                   extend the proposed framework to deal with large-scale data.
                   Experimental results on various synthetic and six real world
                   datasets show that the proposed method compares favorably
                   with baselines and can uncover the underlying structure

                 isoform regulation from high-throughput sequencing of cDNA
                 fragments (RNA-seq), we developed the mixture-of-isoforms
                 (MISO) model, a statistical model that estimates expression of
                 alternatively spliced exons and isoforms and assesses
                 confidence in these estimates. Incorporation of mRNA fragment
                 length distribution in paired-end RNA-seq greatly improved
                 estimation of alternative-splicing levels. MISO also detects
                 differentially regulated exons or isoforms. Application of
                 MISO implicated the RNA splicing factor hnRNP H1 in the
                 regulation of alternative cleavage and polyadenylation, a role

                 Here, microarray and in situ single cell expression methods
                 were used to study Vibrio cholerae growth and virulence gene
                 expression during infection of the rabbit ligated ileal loop
                 model of cholera. Genes encoding the toxin-coregulated pilus
                 (TCP) and cholera toxin (CT) were powerfully expressed early
                 in the infectious process in bacteria adjacent to epithelial
                 surfaces. Increased growth was found to co-localize with
                 virulence gene expression. Significant heterogeneity in the
                 expression of tcpA, the repeating subunit of TCP, was observed
                 late in the infectious process. The expression of tcpA,
                 studied in single cells in a homogeneous medium, demonstrated
                 unimodal induction of tcpA after addition of bicarbonate, a
                 chemical inducer of virulence gene expression. Striking
                 bifurcation of the population occurred during entry into
                 stationary phase: one subpopulation continued to express tcpA,
                 whereas the expression declined in the other subpopulation.
                 ctxA, encoding the A subunit of CT, and toxT, encoding the
                 proximal master regulator of virulence gene expression also
                 exhibited the bifurcation phenotype. The bifurcation phenotype
                 was found to be reversible, epigenetic and to persist after
                 removal of bicarbonate, features consistent with bistable
                 switches. The bistable switch requires the positive-feedback
                 circuit controlling ToxT expression and formation of the
                 CRP-cAMP complex during entry into stationary phase. Key
                 features of this bistable switch also were demonstrated in
                 vivo, where striking heterogeneity in tcpA expression was
                 observed in luminal fluid in later stages of the infection.
                 When this fluid was diluted into artificial seawater,
                 bacterial aggregates continued to express tcpA for prolonged
                 periods of time. The bistable control of virulence gene
                 expression points to a mechanism that could generate a
                 subpopulation of V. cholerae that continues to produce TCP and
                 CT in the rice water stools of cholera patients.",

                 are considered to play important roles in the development and

                 retain a common architecture with the PAZ motif in the middle
                 and Piwi motif in the C-terminal region. Based on the sequence
                 comparison, eight members of the Argonaute family were
                 classified into two subfamilies: the PIWI subfamily
                 (PIWIL1/HIWI, PIWIL2/HILI, PIWIL3, and PIWIL4/HIWI2) and the
                 eIF2C/AGO subfamily (EIF2C1/hAGO1, EIF2C2/hAGO2, EIF2C3/hAGO3,

                 panels indicated that all four members of the PIWI subfamily

                 that the proteins from members of both subfamilies are
                 associated with DICER. We postulate that at least some members

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Homeobox genes are the key regulators during
                 development, and they are in general highly conserved with
                 only a few reported cases of rapid evolution. RHOXF2 is an
                 X-linked homeobox gene in primates. It is highly expressed in
                 the testicle and may play an important role in
                 spermatogenesis. As male reproductive system is often the
                 target of natural and/or sexual selection during evolution, in
                 this study, we aim to dissect the pattern of molecular
                 evolution of RHOXF2 in primates and its potential functional
                 consequence. RESULTS: We studied sequences and copy number
                 variation of RHOXF2 in humans and 16 nonhuman primate species
                 as well as the expression patterns in human, chimpanzee,
                 white-browed gibbon and rhesus macaque. The gene copy number
                 analysis showed that there had been parallel gene
                 duplications/losses in multiple primate lineages. Our evidence
                 suggests that 11 nonhuman primate species have one RHOXF2
                 copy, and two copies are present in humans and four Old World
                 monkey species, and at least 6 copies in chimpanzees. Further
                 analysis indicated that the gene duplications in primates had
                 likely been mediated by endogenous retrovirus (ERV) sequences
                 flanking the gene regions. In striking contrast to non-human
                 primates, humans appear to have homogenized their two RHOXF2
                 copies by the ERV-mediated non-allelic recombination
                 mechanism. Coding sequence and phylogenetic analysis suggested
                 multi-lineage strong positive selection on RHOXF2 during
                 primate evolution, especially during the origins of humans and
                 chimpanzees. All the 8 coding region polymorphic sites in
                 human populations are non-synonymous, implying on-going
                 selection. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that besides
                 the preferential expression in the reproductive system, RHOXF2
                 is also expressed in the brain. The quantitative data suggests
                 expression pattern divergence among primate species.
                 CONCLUSIONS: RHOXF2 is a fast-evolving homeobox gene in
                 primates. The rapid evolution and copy number changes of
                 RHOXF2 had been driven by Darwinian positive selection acting
                 on the male reproductive system and possibly also on the
                 central nervous system, which sheds light on understanding the
                 role of homeobox genes in adaptive evolution.",

                 transitional cell states exists between these discrete stages.
                 We combine the depth of single-cell mass cytometry and an
                 algorithm developed to leverage this continuum by aligning
                 single cells of a given lineage onto a unified trajectory that

                 ability to resolve potential heterogeneities in cell
                 populations. Analyzing such high-dimensional single-cell data
                 has its own statistical and computational challenges. Popular
                 multivariate approaches are based on data normalization,
                 followed by dimension reduction and clustering to identify
                 subgroups. However, in the case of cellular differentiation,
                 we would not expect clear clusters to be present but instead
                 expect the cells to follow continuous branching lineages.
                 RESULTS: Here, we propose the use of diffusion maps to deal
                 with the problem of defining differentiation trajectories. We
                 adapt this method to single-cell data by adequate choice of
                 kernel width and inclusion of uncertainties or missing
                 measurement values, which enables the establishment of a
                 pseudotemporal ordering of single cells in a high-dimensional
                 gene expression space. We expect this output to reflect cell
                 differentiation trajectories, where the data originates from
                 intrinsic diffusion-like dynamics. Starting from a pluripotent
                 stage, cells move smoothly within the transcriptional
                 landscape towards more differentiated states with some
                 stochasticity along their path. We demonstrate the robustness
                 of our method with respect to extrinsic noise (e.g.
                 measurement noise) and sampling density heterogeneities on
                 simulated toy data as well as two single-cell quantitative
                 polymerase chain reaction datasets (i.e. mouse haematopoietic
                 stem cells and mouse embryonic stem cells) and an RNA-Seq data
                 of human pre-implantation embryos. We show that diffusion maps
                 perform considerably better than Principal Component Analysis
                 and are advantageous over other techniques for non-linear
                 dimension reduction such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour
                 Embedding for preserving the global structures and
                 pseudotemporal ordering of cells. AVAILABILITY AND

                 data confound several sources of variation, with contributions
                 from measurement noise, stochastic cell-to-cell variation and
                 cell progression at different rates. Time series from single
                 cell assays are particularly susceptible to confounding as the
                 measurements are not averaged over populations of cells. When
                 several genes are assayed in parallel these effects can be
                 estimated and corrected for under certain smoothness
                 assumptions on cell progression. RESULTS: We present a
                 principled probabilistic model with a Bayesian inference
                 scheme to analyse such data. We demonstrate our method's
                 utility on public microarray, nCounter and RNA-seq data sets
                 from three organisms. Our method almost perfectly recovers
                 withheld capture times in an Arabidopsis data set, it
                 accurately estimates cell cycle peak times in a human prostate
                 cancer cell line and it correctly identifies two precocious
                 cells in a study of paracrine signalling in mouse dendritic
                 cells. Furthermore, our method compares favourably with
                 Monocle, a state-of-the-art technique. We also show using
                 held-out data that uncertainty in the temporal dimension is a
                 common confounder and should be accounted for in analyses of
                 repeated cross-sectional time series. AVAILABILITY: Our method

  abstract    = "Within the bone marrow, stem cells differentiate and give rise
                 to diverse blood cell types and functions. Currently,
                 hematopoietic progenitors are defined using surface markers
                 combined with functional assays that are not directly linked
                 with in vivo differentiation potential or gene regulatory
                 mechanisms. Here, we comprehensively map myeloid progenitor
                 subpopulations by transcriptional sorting of single cells from
                 the bone marrow. We describe multiple progenitor subgroups,
                 showing unexpected transcriptional priming toward seven
                 differentiation fates but no progenitors with a mixed state.
                 Transcriptional differentiation is correlated with
                 combinations of known and previously undefined transcription
                 factors, suggesting that the process is tightly regulated.
                 Histone maps and knockout assays are consistent with early
                 transcriptional priming, while traditional transplantation
                 experiments suggest that in vivo priming may still allow for
                 plasticity given strong perturbations. These data establish a

  abstract    = "Transcript regulation is essential for cell function, and
                 misregulation can lead to disease. Despite technologies to
                 survey the transcriptome, we lack a comprehensive
                 understanding of transcript kinetics, which limits
                 quantitative biology. This is an acute challenge in embryonic
                 development, where rapid changes in gene expression dictate
                 cell fate decisions. By ultra-high-frequency sampling of
                 Xenopus embryos and absolute normalization of sequence reads,
                 we present smooth gene expression trajectories in absolute
                 transcript numbers. During a developmental period
                 approximating the first 8 weeks of human gestation, transcript
                 kinetics vary by eight orders of magnitude. Ordering genes by
                 expression dynamics, we find that ``temporal synexpression''
                 predicts common gene function. Remarkably, a single parameter,
                 the characteristic timescale, can classify transcript kinetics
                 globally and distinguish genes regulating development from
                 those involved in cellular metabolism. Overall, our analysis
                 provides unprecedented insight into the reorganization of
                 maternal and embryonic transcripts and redefines our ability

                 establishment of a metabolically active and proliferative
                 state in T cells after priming, its expression is transient.
                 It remains unknown how T cell activation is maintained after
                 c-Myc expression is downregulated. Here we identified AP4 as
                 the transcription factor that was induced by c-Myc and

                 Mice lacking AP4 specifically in CD8+ T cells showed enhanced

               stages through which individual cells progress during
               reprogramming are largely undefined. Here we use single-cell RNA
               sequencing at multiple time points to dissect direct
               reprogramming from mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced
               neuronal cells. By deconstructing heterogeneity at each time
               point and ordering cells by transcriptome similarity, we find
               that the molecular reprogramming path is remarkably continuous.
               Overexpression of the proneural pioneer factor Ascl1 results in
               a well-defined initialization, causing cells to exit the cell
               cycle and re-focus gene expression through distinct neural
               transcription factors. The initial transcriptional response is
               relatively homogeneous among fibroblasts, suggesting that the
               early steps are not limiting for productive reprogramming.
               Instead, the later emergence of a competing myogenic program and
               variable transgene dynamics over time appear to be the major
               efficiency limits of direct reprogramming. Moreover, a
               transcriptional state, distinct from donor and target cell
               programs, is transiently induced in cells undergoing productive
               reprogramming. Our data provide a high-resolution approach for

                 regulators Oct4 and Sox2 as being highly heterogeneously
                 expressed between blastomeres of the 4-cell embryo, with Sox21
                 showing one of the most heterogeneous expression profiles.
                 Live-cell tracking demonstrates that cells with decreased
                 Sox21 yield more extra-embryonic than pluripotent progeny.
                 Consistently, decreasing Sox21 results in premature
                 upregulation of the differentiation regulator Cdx2, suggesting
                 that Sox21 helps safeguard pluripotency. Furthermore, Sox21 is
                 elevated following increased expression of the histone
                 H3R26-methylase CARM1 and is lowered following CARM1
                 inhibition, indicating the importance of epigenetic
                 regulation. Therefore, our results indicate that heterogeneous
                 gene expression, as early as the 4-cell stage, initiates
                 cell-fate decisions by modulating the balance of pluripotency
                 and differentiation.",

  abstract    = "Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most
                 burdensome form of human malaria, affecting 200-300 million
                 individuals per year worldwide. The recently sequenced genome
                 of P. falciparum revealed over 5,400 genes, of which 60\%
                 encode proteins of unknown function. Insights into the
                 biochemical function and regulation of these genes will
                 provide the foundation for future drug and vaccine development
                 efforts toward eradication of this disease. By analyzing the
                 complete asexual intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC)
                 transcriptome of the HB3 strain of P. falciparum, we
                 demonstrate that at least 60\% of the genome is
                 transcriptionally active during this stage. Our data
                 demonstrate that this parasite has evolved an extremely
                 specialized mode of transcriptional regulation that produces a
                 continuous cascade of gene expression, beginning with genes
                 corresponding to general cellular processes, such as protein
                 synthesis, and ending with Plasmodium-specific
                 functionalities, such as genes involved in erythrocyte
                 invasion. The data reveal that genes contiguous along the
                 chromosomes are rarely coregulated, while transcription from
                 the plastid genome is highly coregulated and likely
                 polycistronic. Comparative genomic hybridization between HB3
                 and the reference genome strain (3D7) was used to distinguish
                 between genes not expressed during the IDC and genes not
                 detected because of possible sequence variations. Genomic
                 differences between these strains were found almost
                 exclusively in the highly antigenic subtelomeric regions of
                 chromosomes. The simple cascade of gene regulation that
                 directs the asexual development of P. falciparum is
                 unprecedented in eukaryotic biology. The transcriptome of the
                 IDC resembles a ``just-in-time'' manufacturing process whereby
                 induction of any given gene occurs once per cycle and only at
                 a time when it is required. These data provide to our
                 knowledge the first comprehensive view of the timing of
                 transcription throughout the intraerythrocytic development of
                 P. falciparum and provide a resource for the identification of
                 new chemotherapeutic and vaccine candidates.",

                 days after activation by antigen recognition on dendritic
                 cells, although how dendritic cells promote this cell-fate
                 decision is not fully understood. Moreover, although Tfh cells
                 are uniquely defined by expression of the follicle-homing
                 receptor CXCR5 (refs 1, 2), the guidance receptor promoting
                 the earlier localization of activated T cells at the interface
                 of the B-cell follicle and T zone has been unclear. Here we
                 show that the G-protein-coupled receptor EBI2 (GPR183) and its
                 ligand 7$\alpha$,25-dihydroxycholesterol mediate positioning
                 of activated CD4 T cells at the interface of the follicle and

                 dendritic cells and are exposed to Tfh-cell-promoting
                 inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) ligand. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is
                 a cytokine that has multiple influences on T-cell fate,

                 mount defective T-cell-dependent plasma cell and germinal
                 centre responses. These findings demonstrate that distinct
                 niches within the lymphoid organ T zone support distinct cell

                 sequencing of 348 oocytes, zygotes and single blastomeres from
                 2- to 3-day-old embryos, we provide a detailed analysis of the

                 129 genes are transcribed during the transition from oocyte to
                 four-cell stage and from four- to eight-cell stage,
                 respectively. A number of identified transcripts originates
                 from previously unannotated genes that include the PRD-like

                 Unlike pluripotent cells, which form embryonic tissues,
                 totipotent cells can generate a complete organism including
                 embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. Cells resembling
                 2-cell-stage embryos (2C-like cells) arise at very low
                 frequency in embryonic stem (ES) cell cultures. Although
                 induced reprogramming to pluripotency is well established,
                 totipotent cells remain poorly characterized, and whether
                 reprogramming to totipotency is possible is unknown. We show
                 that mouse 2C-like cells can be induced in vitro through
                 downregulation of the chromatin-assembly activity of CAF-1.
                 Endogenous retroviruses and genes specific to 2-cell embryos
                 are the highest-upregulated genes upon CAF-1 knockdown.
                 Emerging 2C-like cells exhibit molecular characteristics of
                 2-cell embryos and higher reprogrammability than ES cells upon
                 nuclear transfer. Our results suggest that early
                 embryonic-like cells can be induced by modulating chromatin
                 assembly and that atypical histone deposition may trigger the

  abstract    = "MOTIVATION: Assigning RNA-seq reads to their transcript of
                 origin is a fundamental task in transcript expression
                 estimation. Where ambiguities in assignments exist due to
                 transcripts sharing sequence, e.g. alternative isoforms or
                 alleles, the problem can be solved through probabilistic
                 inference. Bayesian methods have been shown to provide
                 accurate transcript abundance estimates compared with
                 competing methods. However, exact Bayesian inference is
                 intractable and approximate methods such as Markov chain Monte
                 Carlo and Variational Bayes (VB) are typically used. While
                 providing a high degree of accuracy and modelling flexibility,
                 standard implementations can be prohibitively slow for large
                 datasets and complex transcriptome annotations. RESULTS: We
                 propose a novel approximate inference scheme based on VB and
                 apply it to an existing model of transcript expression
                 inference from RNA-seq data. Recent advances in VB
                 algorithmics are used to improve the convergence of the
                 algorithm beyond the standard Variational Bayes Expectation
                 Maximization algorithm. We apply our algorithm to simulated
                 and biological datasets, demonstrating a significant increase
                 in speed with only very small loss in accuracy of expression
                 level estimation. We carry out a comparative study against
                 seven popular alternative methods and demonstrate that our new
                 algorithm provides excellent accuracy and inter-replicate
                 consistency while remaining competitive in computation time.
                 AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The methods were implemented
                 in R and C++, and are available as part of the BitSeq project
                 at github.com/BitSeq. The method is also available through the
                 BitSeq Bioconductor package. The source code to reproduce all

                 small population of epitope-specific naive T cells expands by
                 several orders of magnitude. Second, the T cells within this
                 proliferating population take on diverse functional and
                 phenotypic properties that determine their ability to exert
                 effector functions and contribute to T cell memory. Recent
                 technological advances in lineage tracing allow us for the
                 first time to study these processes in vivo at single-cell
                 resolution. Here, we summarize resulting data demonstrating
                 that although epitope-specific T cell responses are
                 reproducibly similar at the population level, expansion
                 potential and diversification patterns of the offspring
                 derived from individual T cells are highly variable during

                 stochastic response variation, individual memory T cells can
                 serve as adult stem cells that provide robust regeneration of
                 an epitope-specific tissue through population averaging. We

                 for an organism's response to environmental change is an
                 important issue in molecular biology. A first and important
                 step towards this goal is to detect genes whose expression
                 levels are affected by altered external conditions. A range of
                 methods to test for differential gene expression, both in
                 static as well as in time-course experiments, have been
                 proposed. While these tests answer the question whether a gene
                 is differentially expressed, they do not explicitly address
                 the question when a gene is differentially expressed, although
                 this information may provide insights into the course and
                 causal structure of regulatory programs. In this article, we
                 propose a two-sample test for identifying intervals of
                 differential gene expression in microarray time series. Our
                 approach is based on Gaussian process regression, can deal
                 with arbitrary numbers of replicates, and is robust with
                 respect to outliers. We apply our algorithm to study the
                 response of Arabidopsis thaliana genes to an infection by a
                 fungal pathogen using a microarray time series dataset
                 covering 30,336 gene probes at 24 observed time points. In
                 classification experiments, our test compares favorably with

                 in single cells is crucial for understanding and modeling
                 cellular systems. We developed an automated microfluidic

                 modeling the dynamic changes associated with cell
                 differentiation. SCUBA draws techniques from nonlinear

                 providing a systematic framework for modeling complex
                 processes involving multilineage specifications. By applying
                 SCUBA to analyze two complementary, publicly available

                 during early development of mouse embryos, modeled the dynamic
                 changes in gene expression patterns, and predicted the effects
                 of perturbing key transcriptional regulators on inducing
                 lineage biases. The results were robust with respect to

                 Analysis of a hematopoietic dataset suggests that our method

                 differential gene expression experiments, but it is not clear

                 biological interpretation of the results or which statistical
                 tools are best for analyzing the data. An RNA-seq experiment
                 with 48 biological replicates in each of two conditions was
                 performed to answer these questions and provide guidelines for
                 experimental design. With three biological replicates, eight
                 of the 11 tools evaluated found only 20\%-40\% of the
                 significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes identified
                 with the full set of 42 clean replicates. This rises to >85\%
                 for the subset of SDE genes changing in expression by more
                 than fourfold. To achieve >85\% for all SDE genes regardless
                 of fold change requires more than 20 biological replicates.
                 The same eight tools successfully control their false
                 discovery rate at ≲5\% for all numbers of replicates, while
                 the remaining three tools fail to control their FDR
                 adequately, particularly for low numbers of replicates. For
                 future RNA-seq experiments, these results suggest that more
                 than six biological replicates should be used, rising to more
                 than 12 when it is important to identify SDE genes for all

                 combination of true positive and false positive performances

  abstract    = "Vertebrate genomes encode large and highly variable numbers of
                 tandem C2H2 zinc finger (tandem ZF) transcription factor
                 proteins. In mammals, most tandem ZF genes also encode a KRAB
                 domain (KZNF proteins). Very little is known about what forces
                 have driven the number and diversity of tandem ZF genes.
                 Recent studies suggest that one role of KZNF proteins is to
                 bind and repress transcription of exogenous retroviruses and
                 their endogenous counterpart LTR retroelements. We report a
                 striking correlation across vertebrate genomes between the
                 number of LTR retroelements and the number of host tandem ZF
                 genes. This correlation is specific to LTR retroelements and
                 ZF genes and was not explained by covariation in other genomic
                 features. We further show that recently active LTR
                 retroelements are correlated with recent tandem ZF gene
                 duplicates across vertebrates. On branches of the primate
                 phylogeny, we find that the appearance of new families of
                 endogenous retroviruses is strongly predictive of the
                 appearance of new duplicate KZNF genes. We hypothesize that
                 retroviral and LTR retroelement burden drives evolution of
                 host tandem ZF genes. This hypothesis is consistent with
                 previously described molecular evolutionary patterns in
                 duplicate ZF genes throughout vertebrates. To further explore
                 these patterns, we investigated 34 duplicate human KZNF gene
                 pairs, all of which underwent an early burst of divergence in
                 the major nucleotide contact residues of their ZF domains,
                 followed by purifying selection in both duplicates. Our
                 results support a host-pathogen model for tandem ZF gene
                 evolution, in which new LTR retroelement challenges drive
                 duplication and divergence of host tandem ZF genes.",

  abstract      = "Time course data are often used to study the changes to a
                   biological process after perturbation. Statistical methods
                   have been developed to determine whether such a perturbation
                   induces changes over time, e.g. comparing a perturbed and
                   unperturbed time course dataset to uncover differences.
                   However, existing methods do not provide a principled
                   statistical approach to identify the specific time when the
                   two time course datasets first begin to diverge after a
                   perturbation; we call this the perturbation time. Estimation
                   of the perturbation time for different variables in a
                   biological process allows us to identify the sequence of
                   events following a perturbation and therefore provides
                   valuable insights into likely causal relationships. In this
                   paper, we propose a Bayesian method to infer the
                   perturbation time given time course data from a wild-type
                   and perturbed system. We use a non-parametric approach based
                   on Gaussian Process regression. We derive a probabilistic
                   model of noise-corrupted and replicated time course data
                   coming from the same profile before the perturbation time
                   and diverging after the perturbation time. The likelihood
                   function can be worked out exactly for this model and the
                   posterior distribution of the perturbation time is obtained
                   by a simple histogram approach, without recourse to complex
                   approximate inference algorithms. We validate the method on
                   simulated data and apply it to study the transcriptional

                 such studies are hidden confounding factors, such as
                 unobserved covariates or unknown subtle environmental
                 perturbations. These factors can induce a pronounced
                 artifactual correlation structure in the expression profiles,
                 which may create spurious false associations or mask real
                 genetic association signals. Here, we report PANAMA
                 (Probabilistic ANAlysis of genoMic dAta), a novel
                 probabilistic model to account for confounding factors within
                 an eQTL analysis. In contrast to previous methods, PANAMA
                 learns hidden factors jointly with the effect of prominent

                 confounding variation. We applied our model and compared it to
                 existing methods on different datasets and biological systems.
                 PANAMA consistently performs better than alternative methods,

                 one generation to the next and for maintaining the
                 continuation of species. Here, we analyze the transcriptome of
                 human primordial germ cells (PGCs) from the migrating stage to
                 the gonadal stage at single-cell and single-base resolutions.
                 Human PGCs show unique transcription patterns involving the
                 simultaneous expression of both pluripotency genes and
                 germline-specific genes, with a subset of them displaying
                 developmental-stage-specific features. Furthermore, we analyze
                 the DNA methylome of human PGCs and find global demethylation
                 of their genomes. Approximately 10 to 11 weeks after
                 gestation, the PGCs are nearly devoid of any DNA methylation,
                 with only 7.8\% and 6.0\% of the median methylation levels in
                 male and female PGCs, respectively. Our work paves the way
                 toward deciphering the complex epigenetic reprogramming of the
                 germline with the aim of restoring totipotency in fertilized

  abstract    = "Informal verbal interaction is the core matrix for human
                 social life. A mechanism for coordinating this basic mode of
                 interaction is a system of turn-taking that regulates who is
                 to speak and when. Yet relatively little is known about how
                 this system varies across cultures. The anthropological
                 literature reports significant cultural differences in the
                 timing of turn-taking in ordinary conversation. We test these
                 claims and show that in fact there are striking universals in
                 the underlying pattern of response latency in conversation.
                 Using a worldwide sample of 10 languages drawn from
                 traditional indigenous communities to major world languages,
                 we show that all of the languages tested provide clear
                 evidence for a general avoidance of overlapping talk and a
                 minimization of silence between conversational turns. In
                 addition, all of the languages show the same factors
                 explaining within-language variation in speed of response. We
                 do, however, find differences across the languages in the
                 average gap between turns, within a range of 250 ms from the
                 cross-language mean. We believe that a natural sensitivity to
                 these tempo differences leads to a subjective perception of
                 dramatic or even fundamental differences as offered in
                 ethnographic reports of conversational style. Our empirical
                 evidence suggests robust human universals in this domain,
                 where local variations are quantitative only, pointing to a
                 single shared infrastructure for language use with likely
                 ethological foundations.",

  abstract      = "One of the core problems of modern statistics is to
                   approximate difficult-to-compute probability distributions.
                   This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics,
                   which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a
                   calculation about the posterior. In this paper, we review
                   variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning
                   that approximates probability distributions through
                   optimization. VI has been used in myriad applications and
                   tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov
                   chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first
                   posit a family of distributions and then to find the member
                   of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is
                   measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas
                   behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special
                   case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a
                   full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and
                   derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale
                   up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and
                   highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is
                   not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is
                   to catalyze statistical research on this widely-used class

                 clustering, and data set parameterization can be solved within
                 one and the same framework. The main idea is to define a
                 system of coordinates with an explicit metric that reflects
                 the connectivity of a given data set and that is robust to
                 noise. Our construction, which is based on a Markov random
                 walk on the data, offers a general scheme of simultaneously
                 reorganizing and subsampling graphs and arbitrarily shaped
                 data sets in high dimensions using intrinsic geometry. We show
                 that clustering in embedding spaces is equivalent to
                 compressing operators. The objective of data partitioning and
                 clustering is to coarse-grain the random walk on the data
                 while at the same time preserving a diffusion operator for the
                 intrinsic geometry or connectivity of the data set up to some
                 accuracy. We show that the quantization distortion in
                 diffusion space bounds the error of compression of the
                 operator, thus giving a rigorous justification for k-means
                 clustering in diffusion space and a precise measure of the

                 genes of interest, forward genetics remains zebrafish's
                 particular strength. Mutants with diverse and interesting
                 hematopoietic defects are emerging from multiple genetic
                 screens. Some mutants model hereditary blood diseases,
                 occasionally leading to disease genes first; others provide
                 insights into developmental hematology. Models of malignant
                 hematologic disorders provide tools for drug-target and
                 pharmaceutics discovery. Numerous transgenic zebrafish with
                 fluorescently marked blood cells enable live-cell imaging of
                 inflammatory responses and host-pathogen interactions
                 previously inaccessible to direct observation in vivo,
                 revealing unexpected aspects of leukocyte behavior. Zebrafish
                 disease models almost uniquely provide a basis for efficient
                 whole animal chemical library screens for new therapeutics.
                 Despite some limitations and challenges, their successes and
                 discovery potential mean that zebrafish are here to stay in

                 with putative full-length ORF from a zebrafish kidney marrow
                 cDNA library. The ESTs formed 7,742 assemblies, representing
                 both previously identified zebrafish ESTs (56\%) and recently
                 discovered zebrafish ESTs (44\%). About 30\% of these EST
                 assemblies have orthologues in humans, including 1,282
                 disease-associated genes in the Online Mendelian Inheritance

                 regulatory molecules related to erythroid functions across

                 Interestingly, both embryonic and adult zebrafish globin genes

                 be a homogeneous population of cells with flexible behavior.
                 Now a new picture has emerged: The HSC compartment consists of
                 several subpopulations of HSCs each with distinct,
                 preprogrammed differentiation and proliferation behaviors.
                 These programs are epigenetically fixed and are stably
                 bequeathed to all daughter HSCs on self-renewal. HSCs within
                 each subset are remarkably similar in their self- renewal and
                 differentiation behaviors, to the point where their life span
                 can be predicted with mathematical certainty. Three subsets
                 can be distinguished when HSCs are classified by their
                 differentiation capacity: myeloid-biased, balanced, and
                 lymphoid-biased HSCs. The relative number of the HSC subsets
                 is developmentally regulated. Lymphoid-biased HSCs are found
                 predominantly early in the life of an organism, whereas
                 myeloid-biased HSCs accumulate in aged mice and humans. Thus,
                 the discovery of distinct subpopulations of HSCs has led to a
                 new understanding of HCS aging. This finding has implications
                 for other aspects of HSC biology and applications in
                 re-generative medicine. The possibility that other adult

                 expression states for some variable genes heritable through
                 multiple cell divisions. Expression variability and population
                 heterogeneity can be influenced by perturbation of signalling

                 approach for understanding the extent, basis and function of
                 gene expression variation between seemingly identical cells.
                 Here we sequence single-cell RNA-seq libraries prepared from
                 over 1,700 primary mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells
                 spanning several experimental conditions. We find substantial
                 variation between identically stimulated dendritic cells, in
                 both the fraction of cells detectably expressing a given
                 messenger RNA and the transcript's level within expressing
                 cells. Distinct gene modules are characterized by different
                 temporal heterogeneity profiles. In particular, a 'core'
                 module of antiviral genes is expressed very early by a few
                 'precocious' cells in response to uniform stimulation with a
                 pathogenic component, but is later activated in all cells. By
                 stimulating cells individually in sealed microfluidic
                 chambers, analysing dendritic cells from knockout mice, and
                 modulating secretion and extracellular signalling, we show
                 that this response is coordinated by interferon-mediated
                 paracrine signalling from these precocious cells. Notably,
                 preventing cell-to-cell communication also substantially
                 reduces variability between cells in the expression of an
                 early-induced 'peaked' inflammatory module, suggesting that
                 paracrine signalling additionally represses part of the
                 inflammatory program. Our study highlights the importance of
                 cell-to-cell communication in controlling cellular
                 heterogeneity and reveals general strategies that

  abstract    = "Recent molecular studies have shown that, even when derived
                 from a seemingly homogenous population, individual cells can
                 exhibit substantial differences in gene expression, protein
                 levels and phenotypic output, with important functional
                 consequences. Existing studies of cellular heterogeneity,
                 however, have typically measured only a few pre-selected RNAs
                 or proteins simultaneously, because genomic profiling methods
                 could not be applied to single cells until very recently. Here
                 we use single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate heterogeneity
                 in the response of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells
                 (BMDCs) to lipopolysaccharide. We find extensive, and
                 previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger RNA
                 abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by
                 RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization for select transcripts.
                 In particular, hundreds of key immune genes are bimodally
                 expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes that are
                 very highly expressed at the population average. Moreover,
                 splicing patterns demonstrate previously unobserved levels of
                 heterogeneity between cells. Some of the observed bimodality
                 can be attributed to closely related, yet distinct, known
                 maturity states of BMDCs; other portions reflect differences
                 in the usage of key regulatory circuits. For example, we
                 identify a module of 137 highly variable, yet co-regulated,
                 antiviral response genes. Using cells from knockout mice, we
                 show that variability in this module may be propagated through
                 an interferon feedback circuit, involving the transcriptional
                 regulators Stat2 and Irf7. Our study demonstrates the power
                 and promise of single-cell genomics in uncovering functional
                 diversity between cells and in deciphering cell states and
                 circuits.",

                 developed transplantation assays to test the repopulation
                 potentials of candidate hematopoietic progenitor cells. We
                 have been impaired, however, in determining cellular
                 differentiation potentials by a lack of short-term functional
                 assays. To enable more precise analyses of hematopoietic
                 progenitor cells, we have created zebrafish kidney stromal
                 (ZKS) cell lines. Culture of adult whole kidney marrow with
                 ZKS cells results in the maintenance and expansion of
                 hematopoietic precursor cells. Hematopoietic growth is
                 dependent upon ZKS cells, and we show that ZKS cells express
                 many growth factors and ligands previously demonstrated to be
                 important in maintaining mammalian hematopoietic cells. In the
                 absence of exogenous growth factors, ZKS cells maintain early
                 hematopoietic precursors and support differentiation of
                 lymphoid and myeloid cells. With the addition of zebrafish
                 erythropoietin, ZKS cells also support the differentiation of
                 erythroid precursors. These conditions have enabled the
                 ability to ascertain more precisely the points at which
                 hematopoietic mutants are defective. The development of robust

                 been introduced that vary in coverage, sensitivity and

                 reagents. The entire protocol takes ∼2 d from cell picking to
                 having a final library ready for sequencing; sequencing will
                 require an additional 1-3 d depending on the strategy and
                 sequencer. The current limitations are the lack of strand

                 single stem cells have uncovered significant heterogeneity in
                 the functional properties of stem cell populations. This has
                 prompted the development of approaches to study single cells
                 in isolation, often performed using multiparameter flow
                 cytometry. However, many stem cell populations are too rare to
                 test all possible cell surface marker combinations, and
                 virtually nothing is known about functional differences
                 associated with varying intensities of such markers. Here we
                 describe the use of index sorting for further resolution of
                 the flow cytometric isolation of single murine hematopoietic
                 stem cells (HSCs). Specifically, we associate single-cell
                 functional assay outcomes with distinct cell surface marker
                 expression intensities. High levels of both CD150 and EPCR
                 associate with delayed kinetics of cell division and low
                 levels of differentiation. Moreover, cells that do not form
                 single HSC-derived clones appear in the 7AAD(dim) fraction,
                 suggesting that even low levels of 7AAD staining are
                 indicative of less healthy cell populations. These data
                 indicate that when used in combination with single-cell
                 functional assays, index sorting is a powerful tool for
                 refining cell isolation strategies. This approach can be
                 broadly applied to other single-cell systems, both to improve

                 many upstream signalling and downstream effector processes are
                 only partially understood. Genome wide association studies
                 (GWAS) have been particularly useful in providing new
                 directions to dissect these pathways. A GWAS meta-analysis
                 identified 68 genetic loci controlling platelet size and
                 number. Only a quarter of those genes, however, are known
                 regulators of hematopoiesis. To determine function of the
                 remaining genes we performed a medium-throughput genetic
                 screen in zebrafish using antisense morpholino
                 oligonucleotides (MOs) to knock down protein expression,
                 followed by histological analysis of selected genes using a

                 millions of cells per second throughout life. Megakaryocytes
                 in the bone marrow are responsible for the continuous
                 production of platelets in the blood, crucial for preventing
                 bleeding--a common and life-threatening side effect of many
                 cancer therapies--and major efforts are focused at identifying
                 the most suitable cellular and molecular targets to enhance
                 platelet production after bone marrow transplantation or

                 subsets exist that are stably biased towards the generation of
                 lymphoid or myeloid blood cells, we are yet to learn whether
                 other types of lineage-biased HSC exist or understand their
                 inter-relationships and how differently lineage-biased HSCs
                 are generated and maintained. The functional relevance of
                 notable phenotypic and molecular similarities between
                 megakaryocytes and bone marrow cells with an HSC cell-surface
                 phenotype remains unclear. Here we identify and prospectively
                 isolate a molecularly and functionally distinct mouse HSC
                 subset primed for platelet-specific gene expression, with
                 enhanced propensity for short- and long-term reconstitution of

                 depends on thrombopoietin, the primary extrinsic regulator of
                 platelet development. Platelet-primed HSCs also frequently
                 have a long-term myeloid lineage bias, can self-renew and give
                 rise to lymphoid-biased HSCs. These findings show that HSC
                 subtypes can be organized into a cellular hierarchy, with
                 platelet-primed HSCs at the apex. They also demonstrate that
                 molecular and functional priming for platelet development
                 initiates already in a distinct HSC population. The

                 Evidence is accumulating that during the evolution of
                 vertebrates from early deuterostome ancestors entire genomes
                 were duplicated through two rounds of duplications (the
                 'one-to-two-to-four' rule). The first genome duplication in
                 chordate evolution might predate the Cambrian explosion. The
                 second genome duplication possibly dates back to the early
                 Devonian. Recent data suggest that later in the Devonian, the
                 fish genome was duplicated for a third time to produce up to
                 eight copies of the original deuterostome genome. This last
                 duplication took place after the two major radiations of jawed
                 vertebrate life, the ray-finned fish (Actinopterygia) and the
                 sarcopterygian lineage, diverged. Therefore the sarcopterygian
                 fish, which includes the coelacanth, lungfish and all land
                 vertebrates such as amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals,
                 tend to have only half the number of genes compared with
                 actinopterygian fish. Although many duplicated genes turned
                 into pseudogenes, or even 'junk' DNA, many others evolved new
                 functions particularly during development. The increased
                 genetic complexity of fish might reflect their evolutionary

                 is needed for chromosome condensation in yeast and in Xenopus

                 cells before mitosis in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, but
                 also produce DNA damage, which causes arrest through

                 whether cells need topoisomerase II to leave G2, or control
                 late-cycle progression in response to its activity.
                 Bisdioxopiperazines are topoisomerase II inhibitors that act

                 caffeine override this block to produce abortively condensed

                 primary hemostasis. A dysfunction in this protein or an
                 insufficient production of the protein leads to improper
                 platelet adhesion/aggregation, resulting in a bleeding
                 phenotype known as von Willebrand disease (vWD). To gain a
                 better understanding of vWF interactions in vivo, the use of
                 zebrafish as a model is ideal because of the transparency of
                 the embryos and larvae. In this article, we examined the
                 presence and function of vWF in hemostasis of zebrafish
                 utilizing a variety of molecular methods. Using RT-PCR and
                 antibody staining, we have shown that vWF mRNA is present in
                 thrombocytes. Through antibody staining, we demonstrated vWF
                 is synthesized in blood vessels. The role of zebrafish vWF in
                 hemostasis was established through knockdown methods using vWF
                 morpholino (vWF MO) antisense oligonucleotides. Embryos
                 injected with vWF MO at the one to four cell stages resulted
                 in a bleeding phenotype. Injection of embryos with vWF MO also
                 caused an increase in time to occlusion within arteries in
                 larvae upon laser induced injury. We then used vWF-specific
                 Vivo-morpholinos (VMO) to induce vWF knockdown in adult
                 zebrafish by targeting the exon homologous to the human exon
                 28 of the vWF gene. The reduced ristocetin-mediated
                 agglutination of thrombocytes in a plate tilting assay, using
                 blood from adult zebrafish injected with VMO, provided
                 evidence that vWF is involved in the hemostatic process. We
                 also administered desmopressin acetate to larvae and adults
                 which resulted in enhanced aggregation/agglutination of
                 thrombocytes. Zebrafish genome database analysis revealed the
                 presence of GPIb$\beta$ gene. It also revealed the exon of
                 zebrafish vWF gene corresponding to exon 28 of human vWF gene
                 is highly similar to the exon 28 of human vWF gene, except
                 that it has an insertion that leads to a translated peptide
                 sequence that separates the two A domains coded by this exon.
                 This exon is also conserved in other fishes. In summary, we
                 established that zebrafish vWF has a role similar to that of
                 vWF found in humans, thus, making zebrafish a useful model for
                 studying the cell biology of vWF in vivo.",

                 version of Mastermind. Dll4 impaired the generation of mature
                 CD41a(+)CD42b(+) cells and proplatelet formation without
                 affecting earlier steps of MK differentiation, such as
                 production of megakaryocytic/erythroid progenitors and
                 colony-forming units-MKs. This blockade was accompanied by a
                 modulation of the transcriptional program of megakaryocytic
                 differentiation. All these results indicate that Dll4/Notch
                 signaling inhibits human terminal MK differentiation.",

                 CD34(high)CD38(low)Thy1(+) primitive progenitors are contained
                 in the population with intermediate CD9 expression, thus
                 suggesting that CD9 expression may precede CD38 appearance.
                 Cell sorting shows that colony-forming unit (CFU)-GEMM and
                 CFU-GM are present in high proportions in this fraction and in
                 the fraction with the lowest CD9 expression. Cells with the
                 highest level of CD9 are committed to the B-lymphoid or
                 megakaryocytic (MK) lineages, as shown by the co-expression of
                 either CD19 or CD41/GPIIb and by their strong potential to
                 give rise to CFU-MK. In liquid cultures, CD9(high)CD41(neg)

                 CD9(low) cell culture, even after 6 days. Antibody ligation of
                 cell surface CD9 increased the number of human CFU-MK

                 thought to be involved in the regulation of primitive
                 hematopoietic cells, including stem cells and early committed
                 progenitors, and has also been directly implicated in
                 leukemia. To gain further insight into Hox gene-mediated
                 regulation of hematopoiesis, we investigated the expression
                 pattern of representative Hox genes and two of their
                 cofactors, Pbx1 and Meis1, at different stages of murine
                 hematopoiesis. METHODS: Functionally distinct subpopulations
                 of murine bone marrow (BM) and fetal liver day 14.5 (FL) cells
                 were isolated by flow cytometry, and gene expression of
                 various homeobox-containing genes was assessed by global cDNA
                 amplification technique. RESULTS: Hox genes were found
                 preferentially expressed in hematopoietic stem cell
                 (HSC)-enriched subpopulations and downregulated following
                 differentiation and maturation. This profile of expression was
                 observed at both adult and fetal stages of hematopoiesis. The
                 Pbx1 and Meis1 genes had important differences in their
                 expression pattern but were both detected in Hox expressing
                 subpopulations. In particular, Meis1 consistently showed an
                 expression profile closely resembling that of Hox genes.
                 Finally, using the in vitro embryonic stem (ES) cell
                 differentiation model to mimic embryonic hematopoiesis, we
                 found coexpression of Hox genes and their cofactors coincided
                 with the appearance of hematopoietic progenitor cells.
                 CONCLUSION: Together, these results further support the notion
                 that Hox genes are involved in the regulation of early
                 hematopoietic cells and provide strong evidence that they are
                 involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis throughout

                 possess the ability of both multipotency and self-renewal.
                 Multipotency is the ability to differentiate into all

                 manipulation make the zebrafish (Danio rerio) an excellent
                 model for studying hematopoiesis. Using flow cytometry, we
                 identified 2 populations of CD41-GFP(+) cells (GFP(hi) and
                 GFP(lo)) in the whole kidney marrow of Tg(CD41:GFP) zebrafish.
                 Past studies in humans and mice have shown that CD41 is
                 transiently expressed in the earliest hematopoietic
                 progenitors and is then silenced, reappearing in the
                 platelet/thrombocyte lineage. We have transplanted flow-sorted
                 GFP(hi) and GFP(lo) cells into irradiated adult zebrafish and
                 assessed long-term hematopoietic engraftment. Transplantation
                 of GFP(hi) cells did not reconstitute hematopoiesis. In
                 contrast, we observed multilineage hematopoiesis up to 68
                 weeks after primary and secondary transplantation of GFP(lo)
                 cells. We detected the CD41-GFP transgene in all major
                 hematopoietic lineages and CD41-GFP(+) cells in histologic
                 sections of kidneys from transplant recipients. These studies
                 show that CD41-GFP(lo) cells fulfill generally accepted
                 criteria for HSCs. The identification of fluorescent zebrafish
                 HSCs, coupled with our ability to transplant them into
                 irradiated adult recipients, provide a valuable new tool to
                 track HSC homing, proliferation, and differentiation into
                 hematopoietic cells.",

                 the platelet receptor for fibrinogen and several other
                 extracellular matrix molecules. Recent evidence suggests that
                 its expression is much wider in the hematopoietic system than
                 was previously thought. To investigate the precise expression
                 of the CD41 antigen during megakaryocyte (MK) differentiation,
                 CD34(+) cells from cord blood and mobilized blood cells from
                 adults were grown for 6 days in the presence of stem cell
                 factor and thrombopoietin. Two different pathways of
                 differentiation were observed: one in the adult and one in the
                 neonate cells. In the neonate samples, early MK
                 differentiation proceeded from CD34(+)CD41(-) through a
                 CD34(-)CD41(+)CD42(-) stage of differentiation to more mature
                 cells. In contrast, in the adult samples, CD41 and CD42 were
                 co-expressed on a CD34(+) cell. The rare CD34(+)CD41(+)CD42(-)
                 cell subset in neonates was not committed to MK
                 differentiation but contained cells with all myeloid and
                 lymphoid potentialities along with long-term culture
                 initiating cells (LTC-ICs) and nonobese diabetic/severe
                 combined immune-deficient repopulating cells. In the adult
                 samples, the CD34(+)CD41(+)CD42(-) subset was enriched in MK
                 progenitors, but also contained erythroid progenitors, rare
                 myeloid progenitors, and some LTC-ICs. All together, these
                 results demonstrate that the CD41 antigen is expressed at a
                 low level on primitive hematopoietic cells with a myeloid and
                 lymphoid potential and that its expression is ontogenically
                 regulated, leading to marked differences in the surface

                 mouse hematopoiesis. It is notably expressed on some cells of
                 the intra-aortic hematopoietic clusters, an area where the
                 first adult-repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are
                 generated. Although it is generally accepted that CD41
                 expression marks the onset of primitive/definitive
                 hematopoiesis, there are few published data concerning its
                 expression on HSCs. It is as yet uncertain whether HSCs
                 express CD41 throughout development, and if so, to what level.
                 We performed a complete in vivo transplantation analysis with
                 yolk sac, aorta, placenta, and fetal liver cells, sorted based
                 on CD41 expression level. Our data show that the earliest
                 emerging HSCs in the aorta express CD41 in a time-dependent
                 manner. In contrast, placenta and liver HSCs are CD41⁻. Thus,
                 differential and temporal expression of CD41 by HSCs in the
                 distinct hematopoietic territories suggests a

                 such as cell differentiation is challenging owing to the high

                 Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have
                 difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a
                 transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of

                 originally identified for its specific expression in mouse
                 two-cell stage embryos. Here, we report that the nascent
                 protein synthesis is globally repressed in the Zscan4-positive
                 state of ES cells, which is mediated by the transient
                 expression of newly identified eukaryotic translation

                 exogenous proviruses and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Here,
                 we systematically dissected the cellular factors involved in
                 provirus repression in embryonic carcinomas (ECs) and ESCs by
                 a genome-wide siRNA screen. Histone chaperones (Chaf1a/b),
                 sumoylation factors (Sumo2/Ube2i/Sae1/Uba2/Senp6), and
                 chromatin modifiers (Trim28/Eset/Atf7ip) are key determinants
                 that establish provirus silencing. RNA-seq analysis uncovered
                 the roles of Chaf1a/b and sumoylation modifiers in the
                 repression of ERVs. ChIP-seq analysis demonstrates direct
                 recruitment of Chaf1a and Sumo2 to ERVs. Chaf1a reinforces
                 transcriptional repression via its interaction with members of
                 the NuRD complex (Kdm1a, Hdac1/2) and Eset, while Sumo2
                 orchestrates the provirus repressive function of the canonical
                 Zfp809/Trim28/Eset machinery by sumoylation of Trim28. Our
                 study reports a genome-wide atlas of functional nodes that
                 mediate proviral silencing in ESCs and illuminates the

                 cells in the G(1) and S/G(2)/M phases by dual-color imaging.
                 This technology relies upon ubiquitylation-mediated
                 proteolysis, and transgenic mice expressing Fucci provide a
                 powerful model system with which to study the coordination of
                 the cell cycle and development. The mice were initially
                 generated using the CAG promoter; lines expressing the G(1)
                 and S/G(2)/M phase probes that emitted orange (mKO2) and green
                 (mAG) fluorescence, respectively, were separately constructed.
                 Owing to cell type-biased strength of the CAG promoter as well
                 as the positional effects of random transgenesis, however, we
                 noticed some variability in Fucci expression levels. To
                 control more reliably the expression of cell cycle probes, we
                 used different genetic approaches to create two types of
                 reporter mouse lines with Fucci2 and Rosa26 transcriptional
                 machinery. Fucci2 is a recently developed Fucci derivative,
                 which emits red (mCherry) and green (mVenus) fluorescence and
                 provides better color contrast than Fucci. A new transgenic
                 line, R26p-Fucci2, utilizes the Rosa26 promoter and harbors
                 the G(1) and S/G(2)/M phase probes in a single transgene to
                 preserve their co-inheritance. In the other R26R-Fucci2
                 approach, the two probes are incorporated into Rosa26 locus
                 conditionally. The Cre-mediated loxP recombination technique
                 thus allows researchers to design cell-type-specific Fucci2
                 expression. By performing time-lapse imaging experiments using
                 R26p-Fucci2 and R26-Fucci2 in which R26R-Fucci2 had undergone
                 germline loxP recombination, we demonstrated the great promise
                 of these mouse reporters for studying cell cycle behavior in

  abstract    = "It has long been the dream of biologists to map gene
                 expression at the single-cell level. With such data one might
                 track heterogeneous cell sub-populations, and infer regulatory
                 relationships between genes and pathways. Recently, RNA
                 sequencing has achieved single-cell resolution. What is
                 limiting is an effective way to routinely isolate and process
                 large numbers of individual cells for quantitative in-depth
                 sequencing. We have developed a high-throughput
                 droplet-microfluidic approach for barcoding the RNA from
                 thousands of individual cells for subsequent analysis by
                 next-generation sequencing. The method shows a surprisingly
                 low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other

  abstract    = "The transcriptome of single cells can reveal important
                 information about cellular states and heterogeneity within
                 populations of cells. Recently, single-cell RNA-sequencing has
                 facilitated expression profiling of large numbers of single
                 cells in parallel. To fully exploit these data, it is critical
                 that suitable computational approaches are developed. One key
                 challenge, especially pertinent when considering dividing
                 populations of cells, is to understand the cell-cycle stage of
                 each captured cell. Here we describe and compare five
                 established supervised machine learning methods and a
                 custom-built predictor for allocating cells to their
                 cell-cycle stage on the basis of their transcriptome. In
                 particular, we assess the impact of different normalisation
                 strategies and the usage of prior knowledge on the predictive
                 power of the classifiers. We tested the methods on previously
                 published datasets and found that a PCA-based approach and the
                 custom predictor performed best. Moreover, our analysis shows
                 that the performance depends strongly on normalisation and the
                 usage of prior knowledge. Only by leveraging prior knowledge
                 in form of cell-cycle annotated genes and by preprocessing the
                 data using a rank-based normalisation, is it possible to
                 robustly capture the transcriptional cell-cycle signature
                 across different cell types, organisms and experimental
                 protocols.",

  abstract    = "Promiscuous gene expression (PGE) by thymic epithelial cells
                 (TEC) is essential for generating a diverse T cell antigen
                 receptor repertoire tolerant to self-antigens, and thus for
                 avoiding autoimmunity. Nevertheless, the extent and nature of
                 this unusual expression program within TEC populations and
                 single cells are unknown. Using deep transcriptome sequencing
                 of carefully identified mouse TEC subpopulations, we
                 discovered a program of PGE that is common between medullary
                 (m) and cortical TEC, further elaborated in mTEC, and
                 completed in mature mTEC expressing the autoimmune regulator
                 gene (Aire). TEC populations are capable of expressing up to
                 19,293 protein-coding genes, the highest number of genes known
                 to be expressed in any cell type. Remarkably, in mouse mTEC,
                 Aire expression alone positively regulates 3980
                 tissue-restricted genes. Notably, the tissue specificities of
                 these genes include known targets of autoimmunity in human
                 AIRE deficiency. Led by the observation that genes induced by
                 Aire expression are generally characterized by a repressive
                 chromatin state in somatic tissues, we found these genes to be
                 strongly associated with H3K27me3 marks in mTEC. Our findings
                 are consistent with AIRE targeting and inducing the
                 promiscuous expression of genes previously epigenetically
                 silenced by Polycomb group proteins. Comparison of the
                 transcriptomes of 174 single mTEC indicates that genes induced
                 by Aire expression are transcribed stochastically at low cell
                 frequency. Furthermore, when present, Aire
                 expression-dependent transcript levels were 16-fold higher, on
                 average, in individual TEC than in the mTEC population.",

  abstract    = "Individual mammalian cells exhibit large variability in
                 cellular volume, even with the same absolute DNA content, and
                 so must compensate for differences in DNA concentration in
                 order to maintain constant concentration of gene expression
                 products. Using single-molecule counting and computational
                 image analysis, we show that transcript abundance correlates
                 with cellular volume at the single-cell level due to increased
                 global transcription in larger cells. Cell fusion experiments
                 establish that increased cellular content itself can directly
                 increase transcription. Quantitative analysis shows that this
                 mechanism measures the ratio of cellular volume to DNA
                 content, most likely through sequestration of a
                 transcriptional factor to DNA. Analysis of transcriptional
                 bursts reveals a separate mechanism for gene dosage
                 compensation after DNA replication that enables proper
                 transcriptional output during early and late S phase. Our
                 results provide a framework for quantitatively understanding
                 the relationships among DNA content, cell size, and gene

  abstract    = "Heterogeneous pools of adult neural stem cells (NSCs)
                 contribute to brain maintenance and regeneration after injury.
                 The balance of NSC activation and quiescence, as well as the
                 induction of lineage-specific transcription factors, may
                 contribute to diversity of neuronal and glial fates. To
                 identify molecular hallmarks governing these characteristics,
                 we performed single-cell sequencing of an unbiased pool of
                 adult subventricular zone NSCs. This analysis identified a
                 discrete, dormant NSC subpopulation that already expresses
                 distinct combinations of lineage-specific transcription
                 factors during homeostasis. Dormant NSCs enter a
                 primed-quiescent state before activation, which is accompanied
                 by downregulation of glycolytic metabolism, Notch, and BMP
                 signaling and a concomitant upregulation of lineage-specific
                 transcription factors and protein synthesis. In response to
                 brain ischemia, interferon gamma signaling induces dormant NSC
                 subpopulations to enter the primed-quiescent state. This study
                 unveils general principles underlying NSC activation and
                 lineage priming and opens potential avenues for regenerative
                 medicine in the brain.",

                 hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) challenges our understanding

                 expression studies have been hampered by the presence of

                 populations. To gain deeper insight into the gene expression

                 expression assays. Through bioinformatic integration of these

                 major challenge, particularly if this cell type is rare.
                 Identifying rare cell types, such as stem cells, short-lived
                 progenitors, cancer stem cells, or circulating tumour cells,
                 is crucial to acquire a better understanding of normal or
                 diseased tissue biology. To address this challenge we first
                 sequenced the transcriptome of hundreds of randomly selected
                 cells from mouse intestinal organoids, cultured
                 self-organizing epithelial structures that contain all cell
                 lineages of the mammalian intestine. Organoid buds, like
                 intestinal crypts, harbour stem cells that continuously
                 differentiate into a variety of cell types, occurring at
                 widely different abundances. Since available computational
                 methods can only resolve more abundant cell types, we
                 developed RaceID, an algorithm for rare cell type
                 identification in complex populations of single cells. We
                 demonstrate that this algorithm can resolve cell types
                 represented by only a single cell in a population of randomly
                 sampled organoid cells. We use this algorithm to identify Reg4
                 as a novel marker for enteroendocrine cells, a rare population
                 of hormone-producing intestinal cells. Next, we use Reg4
                 expression to enrich for these rare cells and investigate the
                 heterogeneity within this population. RaceID confirmed the
                 existence of known enteroendocrine lineages, and moreover
                 discovered novel subtypes, which we subsequently validated in
                 vivo. Having validated RaceID we then applied the algorithm to
                 ex vivo-isolated Lgr5-positive stem cells and their direct
                 progeny. We find that Lgr5-positive cells represent a
                 homogenous abundant population of stem cells mixed with a rare
                 population of Lgr5-positive secretory cells. We envision broad
                 applicability of our method for discovering rare cell types
                 and the corresponding marker genes in healthy and diseased
                 organs.",

  abstract    = "Embryonic stem cell (ESC) culture conditions are important for
                 maintaining long-term self-renewal, and they influence
                 cellular pluripotency state. Here, we report single cell
                 RNA-sequencing of mESCs cultured in three different
                 conditions: serum, 2i, and the alternative ground state a2i.
                 We find that the cellular transcriptomes of cells grown in
                 these conditions are distinct, with 2i being the most similar
                 to blastocyst cells and including a subpopulation resembling
                 the two-cell embryo state. Overall levels of intercellular
                 gene expression heterogeneity are comparable across the three
                 conditions. However, this masks variable expression of
                 pluripotency genes in serum cells and homogeneous expression
                 in 2i and a2i cells. Additionally, genes related to the cell
                 cycle are more variably expressed in the 2i and a2i
                 conditions. Mining of our dataset for correlations in gene

                 many processes in biology, including embryonic development and
                 stem cell homeostasis. While heterogeneity of gene expression
                 levels has been extensively studied, less attention has been
                 paid to mRNA polyadenylation isoform choice. 3' untranslated
                 regions regulate mRNA fate, and their choice is tightly
                 controlled during development, but how 3' isoform usage varies
                 within genetically and developmentally homogeneous cell
                 populations has not been explored. Here, we perform
                 genome-wide quantification of polyadenylation site usage in
                 single mouse embryonic and neural stem cells using a novel
                 single-cell transcriptomic method, BATSeq. By applying
                 BATBayes, a statistical framework for analyzing single-cell
                 isoform data, we find that while the developmental state of
                 the cell globally determines isoform usage, single cells from
                 the same state differ in the choice of isoforms. Notably this
                 variation exceeds random selection with equal preference in
                 all cells, a finding that was confirmed by RNA FISH data.
                 Variability in 3' isoform choice has potential implications on

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: CD4(+) T cells are key regulators of the adaptive
                 immune system and can be divided into T helper (Th) cells and
                 regulatory T (Treg) cells. During an immune response Th cells
                 mature from a naive state into one of several effector
                 subtypes that exhibit distinct functions. The transcriptional
                 mechanisms that underlie the specific functional identity of
                 CD4(+) T cells are not fully understood. RESULTS: To assist
                 investigations into the transcriptional identity and
                 regulatory processes of these cells we performed
                 mRNA-sequencing on three murine T helper subtypes (Th1, Th2
                 and Th17) as well as on splenic Treg cells and induced Treg
                 (iTreg) cells. Our integrated analysis of this dataset
                 revealed the gene expression changes associated with these
                 related but distinct cellular identities. Each cell subtype
                 differentially expresses a wealth of 'subtype upregulated'
                 genes, some of which are well known whilst others promise new
                 insights into signalling processes and transcriptional
                 regulation. We show that hundreds of genes are regulated
                 purely by alternative splicing to extend our knowledge of the
                 role of post-transcriptional regulation in cell
                 differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: This CD4(+) transcriptome atlas

                 amplification from library constructions is the primary
                 source. The alternative-sampling coincidence from DNA
                 fragmentation-has not been systematically
                 investigated.Results: With sufficiently high-sequencing depth,
                 sampling-induced read duplication is non-negligible, and
                 removing duplicate reads can overcorrect read counts, causing
                 systemic biases in variant allele fraction and copy number
                 variation estimations. Minimal overcorrection occurs when
                 duplicate reads are identified accounting for their mate
                 reads, inserts are of a variety of lengths and samples are
                 sequenced in separate batches. We investigate sampling-induced
                 read duplication in deep sequencing data with 500$\times$ to

                 biology and often obtained from high-throughput RNA sequencing
                 methods such as Illumina sequence data. These measures need to
                 be normalized to remove technical biases inherent in the
                 sequencing approach, most notably the length of the RNA
                 species and the sequencing depth of a sample. These biases are

                 rmc. We propose a slight modification of RPKM that eliminates
                 this inconsistency and call it TPM for transcripts per

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript
                 abundances are measured. A key challenge in transcript
                 quantification from RNA-Seq data is the handling of reads that
                 map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly
                 important for quantification with de novo transcriptome
                 assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is
                 difficult to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the
                 same gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq
                 experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and
                 whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments.
                 RESULTS: We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package
                 for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or
                 paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates,
                 95\% credibility intervals, and visualization files and can
                 also simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing
                 tools, the software does not require a reference genome. Thus,
                 in combination with a de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM
                 enables accurate transcript quantification for species without
                 sequenced genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has
                 superior or comparable performance to quantification methods
                 that rely on a reference genome. Taking advantage of RSEM's
                 ability to effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we show
                 that accurate gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained
                 with large numbers of short single-end reads. On the other
                 hand, estimates of the relative frequencies of isoforms within
                 single genes may be improved through the use of paired-end
                 reads, depending on the number of possible splice forms for
                 each gene. CONCLUSIONS: RSEM is an accurate and user-friendly
                 software tool for quantifying transcript abundances from
                 RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on the existence of a
                 reference genome, it is particularly useful for quantification
                 with de novo transcriptome assemblies. In addition, RSEM has
                 enabled valuable guidance for cost-efficient design of
                 quantification experiments with RNA-Seq, which is currently
                 relatively expensive.",

                 reflect the biological processes and functions it carries out.
                 We characterized the features of mammalian tissue
                 transcriptomes at the gene level through analysis of RNA deep
                 sequencing (RNA-Seq) data across human and mouse tissues and
                 cell lines. We observed that roughly 8,000 protein-coding
                 genes were ubiquitously expressed, contributing to around 75\%
                 of all mRNAs by message copy number in most tissues. These
                 mRNAs encoded proteins that were often intracellular, and
                 tended to be involved in metabolism, transcription, RNA
                 processing or translation. In contrast, genes for secreted or
                 plasma membrane proteins were generally expressed in only a
                 subset of tissues. The distribution of expression levels was
                 broad but fairly continuous: no support was found for the
                 concept of distinct expression classes of genes. Expression
                 estimates that included reads mapping to coding exons only
                 correlated better with qRT-PCR data than estimates which also
                 included 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). Muscle and liver had
                 the least complex transcriptomes, in that they expressed
                 predominantly ubiquitous genes and a large fraction of the
                 transcripts came from a few highly expressed genes, whereas
                 brain, kidney and testis expressed more complex transcriptomes
                 with the vast majority of genes expressed and relatively small
                 contributions from the most expressed genes. mRNAs expressed
                 in brain had unusually long 3'UTRs, and mean 3'UTR length was
                 higher for genes involved in development, morphogenesis and
                 signal transduction, suggesting added complexity of UTR-based
                 regulation for these genes. Our results support a model in
                 which variable exterior components feed into a large, densely
                 connected core composed of ubiquitously expressed
                 intracellular proteins.",

                 gene knockdown or overexpression, have led to the widespread

                 gene function and increasingly, the study of human genetic

                 overlapping set of completely sequenced large-insert clones

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Time course data from microarrays and
                 high-throughput sequencing experiments require simple,
                 computationally efficient and powerful statistical models to
                 extract meaningful biological signal, and for tasks such as
                 data fusion and clustering. Existing methodologies fail to
                 capture either the temporal or replicated nature of the
                 experiments, and often impose constraints on the data
                 collection process, such as regularly spaced samples, or
                 similar sampling schema across replications. RESULTS: We
                 propose hierarchical Gaussian processes as a general model of
                 gene expression time-series, with application to a variety of
                 problems. In particular, we illustrate the method's capacity
                 for missing data imputation, data fusion and clustering.The
                 method can impute data which is missing both systematically
                 and at random: in a hold-out test on real data, performance is
                 significantly better than commonly used imputation methods.
                 The method's ability to model inter- and intra-cluster
                 variance leads to more biologically meaningful clusters. The
                 approach removes the necessity for evenly spaced samples, an
                 advantage illustrated on a developmental Drosophila dataset
                 with irregular replications. CONCLUSION: The hierarchical
                 Gaussian process model provides an excellent statistical basis
                 for several gene-expression time-series tasks. It has only a
                 few additional parameters over a regular GP, has negligible
                 additional complexity, is easily implemented and can be
                 integrated into several existing algorithms. Our experiments
                 were implemented in python, and are available from the

                 showed that these genes belong to the superfamily of

               essentially consists of randomizing strongly both attribute and

               case, it builds totally randomized trees whose structures are

               Besides accuracy, the main strength of the resulting algorithm

                 component or partial least squares regression perform well in
                 learning tasks on high dimensional spectral data, but cannot
                 explicitly eliminate irrelevant features. The random forest
                 classifier with its associated Gini feature importance, on the
                 other hand, allows for an explicit feature elimination, but
                 may not be optimally adapted to spectral data due to the
                 topology of its constituent classification trees which are
                 based on orthogonal splits in feature space. RESULTS: We
                 propose to combine the best of both approaches, and evaluated
                 the joint use of a feature selection based on a recursive
                 feature elimination using the Gini importance of random
                 forests' together with regularized classification methods on
                 spectral data sets from medical diagnostics, chemotaxonomy,
                 biomedical analytics, food science, and synthetically modified
                 spectral data. Here, a feature selection using the Gini
                 feature importance with a regularized classification by
                 discriminant partial least squares regression performed as
                 well as or better than a filtering according to different
                 univariate statistical tests, or using regression coefficients
                 in a backward feature elimination. It outperformed the direct
                 application of the random forest classifier, or the direct
                 application of the regularized classifiers on the full set of
                 features. CONCLUSION: The Gini importance of the random forest
                 provided superior means for measuring feature relevance on
                 spectral data, but - on an optimal subset of features - the
                 regularized classifiers might be preferable over the random
                 forest classifier, in spite of their limitation to model
                 linear dependencies only. A feature selection based on Gini
                 importance, however, may precede a regularized linear
                 classification to identify this optimal subset of features,
                 and to earn a double benefit of both dimensionality reduction
                 and the elimination of noise from the classification task.",

  abstract    = "High-throughput sequencing has allowed for unprecedented
                 detail in gene expression analyses, yet its efficient
                 application to single cells is challenged by the small
                 starting amounts of RNA. We have developed CEL-Seq, a method
                 for overcoming this limitation by barcoding and pooling
                 samples before linearly amplifying mRNA with the use of one
                 round of in vitro transcription. We show that CEL-Seq gives
                 more reproducible, linear, and sensitive results than a
                 PCR-based amplification method. We demonstrate the power of
                 this method by studying early C. elegans embryonic development
                 at single-cell resolution. Differential distribution of
                 transcripts between sister cells is seen as early as the
                 two-cell stage embryo, and zygotic expression in the somatic
                 cell lineages is enriched for transcription factors. The
                 robust transcriptome quantifications enabled by CEL-Seq will
                 be useful for transcriptomic analyses of complex tissues

                 in many other disciplines, is finding a suitable
                 representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For
                 reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the
                 representation is often sought as a linear transformation of
                 the original data. In other words, each component of the
                 representation is a linear combination of the original
                 variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include
                 principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection
                 pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently

                 representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are
                 statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such
                 a representation seems to capture the essential structure of

                 transcriptome study. Quality control (QC) is critical to
                 ensure that RNA-seq data are of high quality and suitable for
                 subsequent analyses. However, QC is a time-consuming and
                 complex task, due to the massive size and versatile nature of
                 RNA-seq data. Therefore, a convenient and comprehensive QC
                 tool to assess RNA-seq quality is sorely needed. RESULTS: We
                 developed the RSeQC package to comprehensively evaluate
                 different aspects of RNA-seq experiments, such as sequence
                 quality, GC bias, polymerase chain reaction bias, nucleotide
                 composition bias, sequencing depth, strand specificity,
                 coverage uniformity and read distribution over the genome

                 is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the
                 non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read
                 lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing
                 technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from
                 high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length
                 limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To align our large
                 (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we
                 developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference
                 (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq
                 alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed
                 search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed
                 clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other
                 aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the
                 human genome 550 million 2 $\times$ 76 bp paired-end reads per
                 hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time
                 improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to
                 unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can
                 discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion)
                 transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA
                 sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription
                 polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally
                 validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an
                 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the

                 synthesis represents one of the most straightforward
                 approaches to generating full length cDNA for sequencing
                 efforts. However, when applied to very small RNA samples, such
                 as those obtained from tens or hundreds of cells, this
                 approach leads to high background and low cDNA yield due to
                 concatamerization of the TS oligo. RESULTS: In this study, we
                 describe the application of nucleotide isomers that form
                 non-standard base pairs in the template switching oligo to
                 prevent background cDNA synthesis. When such bases are added
                 to the 5' end of the template switching (TS) oligo, they
                 inhibit MMLV-RT from extending the cDNA beyond the TS oligo,
                 thus increasing cDNA yield by reducing formation of
                 concatamers of the TS oligo that are the source of significant
                 background. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that this
                 novel approach for cDNA synthesis has valuable utility for
                 application of ultra-high throughput technologies, such as
                 whole transcriptome sequencing using 454 technology, to very

                 tail that plays several fundamental roles in export,
                 translation and mRNA decay. In mammals, PABPN1 controls the
                 processivity of polyadenylation and the length of poly(A)
                 tails during de novo synthesis. This regulation is less
                 well-detailed in yeast. We have recently demonstrated that
                 Nab2p is necessary and sufficient for the regulation of
                 polyadenylation and that the Pab1p/PAN complex may act at a
                 later stage in mRNA metabolism. Here, we show that the
                 presence of both Pab1p and Nab2p in reconstituted pre-mRNA
                 3'-end processing reactions has no stimulating nor inhibitory
                 effect on poly(A) tail regulation. Importantly, the
                 poly(A)-binding proteins are essential to protect the mature
                 mRNA from being subjected to a second round of processing. We
                 have determined which domains of Nab2p are important to
                 control polyadenylation and found that the RGG-box work in
                 conjunction with the two last essential CCCH-type zinc finger
                 domains. Finally, we have tried to delineate the mechanism by
                 which Nab2p performs its regulation function during
                 polyadenylation: it likely forms a complex with poly(A) tails
                 different from a simple linear deposit of proteins as it has
                 been observed with Pab1p.",

                 transcriptome analysis. However, under certain conditions,
                 only a small amount of material is available, which requires
                 more sensitive techniques that can preferably be used at the
                 single-cell level. Here we describe a single-cell digital gene
                 expression profiling assay. Using our mRNA-Seq assay with only
                 a single mouse blastomere, we detected the expression of 75\%
                 (5,270) more genes than microarray techniques and identified
                 1,753 previously unknown splice junctions called by at least 5
                 reads. Moreover, 8-19\% of the genes with multiple known
                 transcript isoforms expressed at least two isoforms in the
                 same blastomere or oocyte, which unambiguously demonstrated
                 the complexity of the transcript variants at whole-genome
                 scale in individual cells. Finally, for Dicer1(-/-) and
                 Ago2(-/-) (Eif2c2(-/-)) oocytes, we found that 1,696 and 1,553
                 genes, respectively, were abnormally upregulated compared to

                 expression, but it has been technically challenging to
                 generate expression profiles from single cells. Here we
                 describe a robust mRNA-Seq protocol (Smart-Seq) that is
                 applicable down to single cell levels. Compared with existing
                 methods, Smart-Seq has improved read coverage across
                 transcripts, which enhances detailed analyses of alternative
                 transcript isoforms and identification of single-nucleotide
                 polymorphisms. We determined the sensitivity and quantitative
                 accuracy of Smart-Seq for single-cell transcriptomics by
                 evaluating it on total RNA dilution series. We found that
                 although gene expression estimates from single cells have
                 increased noise, hundreds of differentially expressed genes
                 could be identified using few cells per cell type. Applying
                 Smart-Seq to circulating tumor cells from melanomas, we
                 identified distinct gene expression patterns, including
                 candidate biomarkers for melanoma circulating tumor cells. Our

                 potential to reveal rare cell populations and lineage
                 relationships but require efficient methods for cell capture
                 and mRNA sequencing. Although cellular barcoding strategies
                 allow parallel sequencing of single cells at ultra-low depths,
                 the limitations of shallow sequencing have not been
                 investigated directly. By capturing 301 single cells from 11
                 populations using microfluidics and analyzing single-cell
                 transcriptomes across downsampled sequencing depths, we
                 demonstrate that shallow single-cell mRNA sequencing (~50,000
                 reads per cell) is sufficient for unbiased cell-type
                 classification and biomarker identification. In the developing
                 cortex, we identify diverse cell types, including multiple
                 progenitor and neuronal subtypes, and we identify EGR1 and FOS
                 as previously unreported candidate targets of Notch signaling
                 in human but not mouse radial glia. Our strategy establishes
                 an efficient method for unbiased analysis and comparison of

  abstract    = "The mammalian lung is a highly branched network in which the
                 distal regions of the bronchial tree transform during
                 development into a densely packed honeycomb of alveolar air
                 sacs that mediate gas exchange. Although this transformation
                 has been studied by marker expression analysis and
                 fate-mapping, the mechanisms that control the progression of
                 lung progenitors along distinct lineages into mature alveolar
                 cell types are still incompletely known, in part because of
                 the limited number of lineage markers and the effects of
                 ensemble averaging in conventional transcriptome analysis
                 experiments on cell populations. Here we show that single-cell
                 transcriptome analysis circumvents these problems and enables
                 direct measurement of the various cell types and hierarchies
                 in the developing lung. We used microfluidic single-cell RNA
                 sequencing (RNA-seq) on 198 individual cells at four different
                 stages encompassing alveolar differentiation to measure the
                 transcriptional states which define the developmental and
                 cellular hierarchy of the distal mouse lung epithelium. We
                 empirically classified cells into distinct groups by using an
                 unbiased genome-wide approach that did not require a priori
                 knowledge of the underlying cell types or the previous
                 purification of cell populations. The results confirmed the
                 basic outlines of the classical model of epithelial cell-type
                 diversity in the distal lung and led to the discovery of many
                 previously unknown cell-type markers, including
                 transcriptional regulators that discriminate between the
                 different populations. We reconstructed the molecular steps
                 during maturation of bipotential progenitors along both
                 alveolar lineages and elucidated the full life cycle of the
                 alveolar type 2 cell lineage. This single-cell genomics
                 approach is applicable to any developing or mature tissue to
                 robustly delineate molecularly distinct cell types, define
                 progenitors and lineage hierarchies, and identify
                 lineage-specific regulatory factors.",

                 for quantifying gene expression heterogeneity in populations
                 of cells. Many techniques have, thus, been recently developed
                 to perform transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) on individual
                 cells. To probe subtle biological variation between samples
                 with limiting amounts of RNA, more precise and sensitive
                 methods are still required. We adapted a previously developed
                 strategy for single-cell RNA-Seq that has shown promise for
                 superior sensitivity and implemented the chemistry in a
                 microfluidic platform for single-cell whole-transcriptome
                 analysis. In this approach, single cells are captured and
                 lysed in a microfluidic device, where mRNAs with poly(A) tails
                 are reverse-transcribed into cDNA. Double-stranded cDNA is
                 then collected and sequenced using a next generation
                 sequencing platform. We prepared 94 libraries consisting of
                 single mouse embryonic cells and technical replicates of
                 extracted RNA and thoroughly characterized the performance of
                 this technology. Microfluidic implementation increased mRNA
                 detection sensitivity as well as improved measurement
                 precision compared with tube-based protocols. With 0.2 M reads
                 per cell, we were able to reconstruct a majority of the bulk
                 transcriptome with 10 single cells. We also quantified
                 variation between and within different types of mouse
                 embryonic cells and found that enhanced measurement precision,
                 detection sensitivity, and experimental throughput aided the
                 distinction between biological variability and technical
                 noise. With this work, we validated the advantages of an early
                 approach to single-cell RNA-Seq and showed that the benefits
                 of combining microfluidic technology with high-throughput
                 sequencing will be valuable for large-scale efforts in

  abstract    = "T helper 2 (Th2) cells regulate helminth infections, allergic
                 disorders, tumor immunity, and pregnancy by secreting various
                 cytokines. It is likely that there are undiscovered Th2
                 signaling molecules. Although steroids are known to be
                 immunoregulators, de novo steroid production from immune cells
                 has not been previously characterized. Here, we demonstrate
                 production of the steroid pregnenolone by Th2 cells in vitro
                 and in vivo in a helminth infection model. Single-cell RNA
                 sequencing and quantitative PCR analysis suggest that
                 pregnenolone synthesis in Th2 cells is related to
                 immunosuppression. In support of this, we show that
                 pregnenolone inhibits Th cell proliferation and B cell
                 immunoglobulin class switching. We also show that
                 steroidogenic Th2 cells inhibit Th cell proliferation in a
                 Cyp11a1 enzyme-dependent manner. We propose pregnenolone as a
                 ``lymphosteroid,'' a steroid produced by lymphocytes. We
                 speculate that this de novo steroid production may be an
                 intrinsic phenomenon of Th2-mediated immune responses to
                 actively restore immune homeostasis.",

                 questions about the performance of different protocols and
                 platforms remain. We used a newly developed pool of 96
                 synthetic RNAs with various lengths, and GC content covering a
                 2(20) concentration range as spike-in controls to measure
                 sensitivity, accuracy, and biases in RNA-seq experiments as
                 well as to derive standard curves for quantifying the
                 abundance of transcripts. We observed linearity between read
                 density and RNA input over the entire detection range and
                 excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed
                 significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure
                 Poisson sampling errors. We use the control RNAs to directly
                 measure reproducible protocol-dependent biases due to GC
                 content and transcript length as well as stereotypic
                 heterogeneity in coverage across transcripts correlated with
                 position relative to RNA termini and priming sequence bias.
                 These effects lead to biased quantification for short
                 transcripts and individual exons, which is a serious problem
                 for measurements of isoform abundances, but that can partially
                 be corrected using appropriate models of bias. By using the
                 control RNAs, we derive limits for the discovery and detection
                 of rare transcripts in RNA-seq experiments. By using data
                 collected as part of the model organism and human Encyclopedia

                 for transcriptome discovery and quantification. These quality

  abstract    = "Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and other primitive stem cells of
                 mice have been known for more than 30 years to potently block
                 retrovirus replication. Infection of ESCs by the murine
                 leukaemia viruses (MLVs) results in the normal establishment
                 of integrated proviral DNA, but this DNA is then
                 transcriptionally silenced, preventing further viral spread.
                 The repression is largely mediated by trans-acting factors
                 that recognize a conserved sequence element termed the primer
                 binding site, an 18-base pair sequence complementary to the 3'
                 end of a cellular transfer RNA. A specific tRNA is annealed to
                 the primer binding site sequence of the viral genomic RNA, and
                 is used to prime DNA synthesis. This same sequence in the
                 context of the integrated proviral DNA is targeted for
                 silencing in ESCs. We have recently shown that a large protein
                 complex binding to the primer binding site in ESCs contains
                 TRIM28 (refs 8, 9), a well-characterized transcriptional
                 co-repressor. An important question remains as to the identity
                 of the factor that directly recognizes integrated retroviral
                 DNAs and recruits TRIM28 to mediate their specific silencing.
                 Here we identify the zinc finger protein ZFP809 as the
                 recognition molecule that bridges the integrated proviral DNA
                 and TRIM28. We show that expression of ZFP809 is sufficient to
                 render even differentiated cells highly resistant to MLV
                 infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ZFP809 is able to
                 potently block transcription from DNA constructs of human
                 T-cell lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1), which use the same
                 primer tRNA. These results identify ZFP809 as a DNA-binding
                 factor that specifically recognizes a large subset of
                 mammalian retroviruses and retroelements, targeting them for
                 transcriptional silencing. We propose that ZFP809 evolved as a
                 stem-cell-specific retroviral restriction factor, and
                 therefore constitutes a new component of the intrinsic immune
                 system of stem cells.",

                 expressed in the mouse testis, which on further molecular
                 characterization proved to be a member of a new family of 14
                 transcribed genes. Six of the genes appear to be expressed
                 pseudogenes. The remainder indicate an open reading frame of
                 approximately 200-220 amino acids encoding proteins with a
                 very high proportion of alpha helical secondary structure,
                 comprising approximately 15\% glutamate residues. Because of
                 this property, the family has been named SPErm-associated
                 glutamate (E)-Rich protein (SPEER). Three members were chosen
                 for more detailed characterization: SPEER-1 (pseudogene),
                 SPEER-2, and SPEER-4D. All three are expressed tissue
                 specifically in the testis of mice, with only very weak
                 expression evident in the rat testis but in no other species
                 tested. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
                 (RT-PCR), all three transcripts can be detected also in the
                 epididymis, presumably due to the presence of spermatozoa. All
                 three transcripts are expressed to high levels in haploid germ
                 cells at the spermatocyte-spermatid transition. SPEER-1 mRNA
                 is present in the cytoplasm as a sense transcript, SPEER-2
                 appears to be made mostly as an antisense transcript, whereas
                 SPEER-4D appears to be localized within a subcellular
                 compartment as a conventional sense transcript. Codon usage
                 analysis suggests that all but the pseudogenes can be
                 expressed as protein, confirmed for SPEER-2 and SPEER-4D by in
                 vitro transcription/translation. An antibody raised against a
                 peptide region of SPEER-4D, which probably cross-reacts with
                 other SPEER members, immunohistochemically stains the nuclei
                 of early round spermatids. While there are no true homologies
                 to other proteins in the genome databases, some motifs are
                 present that suggest a relationship to nuclear matrix
                 proteins, implying that the SPEER family is a new group of
                 haploid sperm-specific nuclear factors.",

                 embryonic stem (ES) cells. However, the genes contributing to
                 this stability remain obscure. We previously identified Zscan4
                 as a specific marker for two-cell embryo and ES cells. Here we
                 show that Zscan4 is involved in telomere maintenance and
                 long-term genomic stability in ES cells. Only 5\% of ES cells
                 express Zscan4 at a given time, but nearly all ES cells
                 activate Zscan4 at least once during nine passages. The
                 transient Zscan4-positive state is associated with rapid
                 telomere extension by telomere recombination and upregulation
                 of meiosis-specific homologous recombination genes, which
                 encode proteins that are colocalized with ZSCAN4 on telomeres.
                 Furthermore, Zscan4 knockdown shortens telomeres, increases
