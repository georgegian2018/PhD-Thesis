\section*{Contributions}

For several studies in this thesis significant work has been undertaken by my collaborators. Each chapter presents this in the introduction, but in brief, we list them here.

\begin{itemize}
    \item For Chapter \ref{ch:power}, we designed experiments to verify our analysis results, and Kedar Natarajan performed these experiments.
    \item In Chapter \ref{ch:zebrafish}, the original study was designed by Ana Cvejic. The experiments with the zebrafish, including cell sorting, were performed by Charlotte Laballette. Iain Macaulay performed single cell RNA-sequencing with these cells. The biological relevance of our results in the light of hematopoiesis was interpreted by Ana Cvejic.
    \item The study presented in Chapter \ref{ch:malaria} was designed by Tapio Lonnberg and Kylie James, together with Ashraful Haque. They also intepreted the results from the models in relation to immunology.
\end{itemize}
